<p>Early to mid-30s, blue skies and an astroturf pitch.&nbsp; So, no swing, no variable bounce, no turn.&nbsp; Just lots of bounce.</p>
<p>So, having slept till 1pm, 10* Villagers arrive after their most drunken night of the whole tour in quite a state.</p>
<p>Ground highlights included distant mountains across a bay, and a neighbouring pool and bar.&nbsp; Oh, and a small patch of shade which was our sanctuary for the next few hours.</p>

<p><strong>The Village Goes Forth</strong></p>
<p>After almost 10 years of hilarious 'cricket', in-fighting, failed coups and far too many pints to remember, The Village CC&nbsp;finally got its act together and went on its first official foreign tour.&nbsp; It just wouldn't have been right and proper, nay, it wouldn't have been cricket if we hadn't gone and lost our first ever foreign tour match.&nbsp; Not just lose, mind.&nbsp; We were pwned in spectacular fashion.</p>
<p>After winning the toss, the honorary captain for the day, Bn, plumped for having a bit.&nbsp; We all looked on with excitement* as Bomb and Harty strode out to the middle.&nbsp; However, it was short lived as Steve was soon out to a sharp, low, diving catch in the slips - the sort of catch that only ever seems to happen to him (see &quot;Parp! Innings&quot;).</p>
<p><strong>Early Hope</strong></p>
<p>Next in was The Example.&nbsp; Between him and Alan, a partnership began to form and the rest of the players began to settle down on the side-lines, after commiserating the dismissed Steve.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It wasn&rsquo;t easy going though, as the ball bounced up high on the AstroTurf pitch, which made it hard to get away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The opening bowlers weren&rsquo;t bad either.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One of them, a brute of a Pakistani, had pace and control.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He clearly knew what he was doing and changed his bowling any time the batsmen took up a new guard to try something different.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite this, we were soon on about 50 for 1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A decent start, we all thought.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But Bomb had different ideas.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He decided that enough was enough and he wanted to see the back of our Great Leader.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So he promptly ran him out.</p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">The Rate Slows</b></p>
<p>Out came the Parp!, and not for the last time that day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He had no intention of staying out in that heat for long and said so &ndash; he&rsquo;d rather be in the pool.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, sadly for our run rate he wasn&rsquo;t true to his word.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Throughout his innings, Parp! edged the ball behind numerous times, only to be dropped again, and again, and again &ndash; including by the same fielder who had caught Harty so expertly.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When this failed to get him out, there was some suicidal running between the wickets from Bomb and Parp!.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Though trying to tell who was attempting to run out who is difficult between the portly twins. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Despite all this crazy running and White&rsquo;s best efforts at returning the ball back to its place of dwelling, the run rate was slipping down as Parp! tried, but failed, to get the ball off the square.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus Bomb took it upon himself to attempt to launch every ball into the next field &ndash; stating matter-of-factly that this is where the ball belongs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It turned out he wasn&rsquo;t <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">quite</i> right.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then the inevitable happened and Alan was bowled for a very respectable 54.</p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Classic Village</b></p>
<p>If you are of a sensitive nature, may I suggest that you avert your gaze now?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps you could have a good old leer at your office hottie?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Spend some time staring absent mindedly out of the window.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Or, give your manager a heart-attack by doing some work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For what follows is a sad tale; one that veteran Villagers now only too well.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Many of them wake in a cold sweat in the night, visions of those ghastly days flashing across their eyes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Yes, after the valiant efforts of Bomb and Frank (31 not out &ndash; as ever), the Village went from roughly 110 for 2 to all out for 140.</p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">The Procession</b></p>
<p>First to fall was Parp!.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Bowled shortly after having been left by his doppelg&auml;nger.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;Good riddance&rdquo; said the rest of the Village as they spied a chance to up the rate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But it wasn&rsquo;t to be.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>John Lucarotti came and went with barely a shot in anger.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Out strode the WLD, full of purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was determined to score this weekend!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Only Troja, who was then starting to look in good shape, went and did the wrong+ thing and ran him out. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Justice was soon served up on behalf of the Welshman though as Troj was trapped in front for 9 &ndash; a shock to all onlookers after his promising start.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Marrow was caught off of the bowling of a child and then the opening bowlers returned to polish off KP and Bn.</p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">An Ugly Scorecard</b></p>
<p>We all trudged off the field to the cooing of our Greek tour organiser who was delighting in the beating his &lsquo;countrymen&rsquo; were handing out to us.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Checking our scores was a mentally disturbing experience for all apart from the Bombus &ndash; but he&rsquo;d soon be regretting ever visiting the Corfu mariner and its mosquitos.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He had, roughly, scored the same number of runs as the other ten batsmen, with only two of them getting into double figures.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Still, The Village is made of sterner stuff these days and, after a few ham sandwiches and gallons of water, we pulled up our socks and went out to bowl with a bounce in our step hoping for some early wickets.</p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">HOME</b></p>
<p>There is a reason for my terminology earlier when talking about where Bomb hit the ball.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Yes, Alan hit some nice shots into the next field, but one large Pakistani (Ahmet, apparently) overruled him and showed us all where the ball&rsquo;s HOME really is.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It wasn&rsquo;t in the next field.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It wasn&rsquo;t even over the parked boats on the back of trailers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It wasn&rsquo;t in the car park behind those, either.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No, it was on the banks of the water several hundred feet away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An idyllic place, one would imagine.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I wouldn&rsquo;t really know as the Villager sent to retrieve the ball hadn&rsquo;t returned by the time we got on the plane to <em>our</em> home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The ball also had a few nice holiday HOMEs elsewhere in the region.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It visited those quite frequently too.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it earned itself quite a lot of air miles in only a few overs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Feeling sorry for us, Ahmet the Destroyer slipped his bat under his armpit and marched off after scoring his half century in about 15 balls.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Along with some decent contributions from those around him, the opposition only needed a handful more runs and they eked them out over the next few overs &ndash; toying with us like a cat playing with a half-dead mouse.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even going so far as to continue playing with our ravaged bodies 15 runs over the winning line &ndash; the bastards.</p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">The After Show Pool Party</b></p>
<p>So, with typical good grace, the Village congratulated the opposition and presented Ahmet with the MoM trophy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Speaking no English whatsoever, he looked quite bemused at our attempts to recruit him to the Village right under the oppo captain&rsquo;s nose.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After a cooling swim in the pool and a game of &ldquo;throw the wobobo ball at your fellow Villager&rsquo;s head&rdquo;, we gathered some sun loungers and drank away the rest of the evening until the special bus (finally) arrived.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The mosquitos also got their fill.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>JL&rsquo;s back was quite a sight, but Bomb, with his anaphylaxis, was the biggest loser &ndash; spending the night in hospital without any travel insurance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clever.</p>
<p>* bleary eyed apathy.</p>
<p>+right thing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As would be attested to by JL, who had been shouting at Nick to run Oli out for the last five minutes.</p>
