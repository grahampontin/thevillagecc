<![endif]-->The Village were disappointed to find a couple of days before the game that the BBC&rsquo;s excellent ground at Burnham (the one with the electric scoreboard, no less) was out of commission. However, the Beeb are not short of excellent venues &ndash; they even play some of their games at the deliciously posh Wellington  College which we must try to do next year in a bid to finally alienate the remaining founding members of the club.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As it was, we&rsquo;d been moved to Beaconsfield Cricket Club, which was very good indeed. Toss won, KP looked at the flat deck and had no hesitation in having a bat, so out walked Hindle and Rohit. However, things weren&rsquo;t as easy as they appeared. Firstly, the pitch had a very damp layer on top, so the new ball kept stopping in the pitch and popping up, to the extent that when they weren&rsquo;t wearing it in the box, they were completely mistiming it and looping it into gaps. And this wasn&rsquo;t helped by the fact that seeing the thing was very tough indeed. It&rsquo;s hard to say why: there was bright sun and sightscreens at either end. It seems likely that the groundsman might have recently painted the screens, and possibly used the wrong paint, giving them a glossy sheen and making them anti-sightscreens.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Anyway, the openers battled away for the first 7 or 8 overs before Hindle finally went, pushing at one that stopped even more than the rest on him. Your correspondent came in and after failing to pick up the entirety of the first over he faced began to get into the groove with a couple of nice fours, until one flew up off a length and took the glove to slip. It&rsquo;s been a sh1t year.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The openers had bowled really well, accurate and seaming it around. Rohit was still struggling to get going, but Old Father Time Harty, playing for the opposition, was brought into the attack and struggled to hit a good length, not helped by the keeper&rsquo;s odd decision to stand up to the stumps for him.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He was perhaps somewhat hastily withdrawn, however: the BBC have lost a few players over the years and it&rsquo;s fair to say the team&rsquo;s change bowlers are not quite what they were. Rohit and Marrow took excellent toll. Both were predictably strong through the off-side, a feature of their game that lead to the BBC posting three fielders in the ark between point and gully. Their efforts were helped by the fact that one of the bowlers appeared to develop the yips three overs into his spell &ndash; beamer followed pea roller followed beamer, and it was only due to some generous umpiring from both the man at square leg and the man behind the bowler&rsquo;s arm that we weren&rsquo;t stuck there till midnight.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Rohit had made a really nice 68 before he clipped one to square leg, and Hayles came and went to a two/three bounce yorker, but KP bludgeoned away to take us past the 200 and force an early declaration. Marrow finished on 66 not out, a splendid knock full of sensible shots working the slower bowlers around and some good hitting when the openers came back.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Tea was taken in the pavilion, and was a hearty medley of cakes, sandwiches, sausage rolls and other treats. Back out on the field, and Kiwi opening pair Boa and Bun struggled to make inroads &ndash; the sun had got to work on the pitch and dried it out, making it an excellent batting track. Khame Persaud looked extremely strong on the pull, but Bun got rid of the other opener after Ek clung on to a good take from a muscular drive.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">With the run rate beginning to climb, KP wasted no time in turning to the Risen Christ, who in between going for a few boundaries tempted two Persauds into careless charges and miscued hoiks with flighted deliveries, both well-pouched by the Example and Marrow. Chris Van Rensburg and Methuselah began to repair the damage with an excellent partnership, both finding the leg side boundary with some thumping pulls. However, KP had saved himself for the middle of the innings and proceeded to single-handedly destroy the BBC&rsquo;s chances of an improbable win. First he found some in-movement to catch Van Rensburg&rsquo;s inside edge and trap Snedden bang in front, and then he produced a superb bit of fielding from long off to run out Pougsie, a flat throw to the bowler&rsquo;s end finding him a couple of yards short.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After that, the game was all but up. Harty defied a recent hip replacement to belt the Example for some massive sixes over square leg and spank Gail Porter back over his head for a maximum, but Koder bowled well at him, beating him a couple of times in the flight and being quite unlucky not to get him. In the end the lower order wickets fell thanks to Boa, who came back and bowled a much better spell, while Ek took out the number seven with a wonderfully-flighted off break and Marrow punished a suicidal single.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The BBC finished about 40 runs short and thanks go to our genial hosts for an excellent pitch and for finding room for Steve in their line up. They promise they&rsquo;ll get us next year. Eight on the bounce, bring on our final game&hellip;.this isn&rsquo;t quite the team this correspondent joined in 2005.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Man of the Match is a tricky one &ndash; Marrow and Rohit batted very well, while KP had a wonderful spell in the middle and contributed some handy lower order runs. Rohit possibly shades it for surviving at the start when the ball was hard to see and doing all sorts, but I&rsquo;m going to cop out and give it to all three.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Village idiot: Hayles takes it for getting yorked by a pea roller.</p>
