<p class="MsoNormal">Our much anticipated match against Strongroom CC was billed by some as the toughest match of the season, and without KP leading the attack, a tough task ahead of us.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On arrival at the picturesque Highgate Wood, the heavens opened causing the start of play to be delayed and the match was reduced to 35 overs a side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Strongroom described the pitch as &lsquo;green and muddy&rsquo;, showing a slightly different perspective from a Village team recently back from Wiltshire, whom thought the track was one of the better ones we had seen in recent times! <span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Village won the toss and sent Strongroom in to face the music of Messers Boa and White.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Strongroom openers showed great intent early with both players striking some lovely shots, however the damp outfield didn&rsquo;t aid their cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bomb, struggling with a chest infection, bowled a very good line and length, and with the help of an energetic Ahmed doing a magnificent job standing up to the stumps, Village managed to apply the brakes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Matty Boa struck first, trapping the classy Newkirk in front for 6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And shortly after Village claimed wicket number 2 after a suicidal run ended in disaster for Strongroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bun came into the attack and struggled to find his length early, and then settled into a terrific rhythm of tight stump to stump bowling, resulting in the amazing figures of 7 overs 1-12.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the other end The Example bowled one of his best spells of the season, claiming 2 wickets bowled, conceding only 21 runs off his 7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A feat made all the more amazing considering how slow the pitch was playing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Village ground fielding was generally excellent, with the only blemishes by way of a dropped sitter at point from an experienced left handed fixtures secretary, and a misjudged outfield chance from some guy with a walking frame.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the end Village managed to restrict Strongroom to 6-114 off their 35 overs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the score was not huge, the quality of our opponents did shine through as the refused to throw away their wickets in search of quick runs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Tarquin and star recruit (and Michael Clarke look-alike) Loonstra lead our reply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Steady progress was made at a rate of around 2 an over against some quality medium pace bowling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the introduction of the change bowlers Loonstra started to open up with a lovely 4 followed by the only six of the day to deep midwicket. However later that over Loonstra skied a ball and was caught trying to repeat the dose, score about 1/40 off 18 overs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Enter the &lsquo;Batsman of the Year&rsquo;.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Morgans strode purposefully to the wicket and looked solid right from the start.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He and Tarquin began to build a partnership and increase the run rate, that is until left arm leg spinner Martin was brought into the attack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Martin bowled 3 overs for 2 runs, and in his fourth nearly claimed the &lsquo;Batsman of the Year&rsquo; to an inside edge that narrowly missed his leg stump.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">However from that point on Morgans put the foot on the accelerator and treated the crowd to a couple of classical drivers for 4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile Hindle was eventually out to the spin of Martin for a well compiled 29, score about 2/70 off 25 overs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That brought Harty to the crease, and with 45 runs to get, he and Morgans set about the task.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The runs started to flow and one big over enabled the Village pair to put the result beyond doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Morgans then celebrated in the next over with a fantastic reverse swipe for 3, and finally Harty hit the winning runs with a lofted drive for 3 on the second ball of the 32<sup>nd</sup> over.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Congratulations to the Village for a fine performance against some strong opponents and all round good guys.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Man of the Match goes to Morgans for an unbeaten 34 in good time on a slow difficult wicket.</p>
