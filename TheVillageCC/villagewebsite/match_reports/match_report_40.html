<p class="MsoBodyText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><strong><em><font face="Verdana" size="2">Village waltz Anna &amp; Simon with the last oppo &ndash; it couldn&rsquo;t be Donne alone. (2,3,2,2,6)</font></em></strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">WHILE the interminable farce that was the Cricket World Cup ended in gloomy confusion in Barbados, the good name of the gentleman&rsquo;s game was dragged still further into the mud by a &ldquo;pedalo incident&rdquo; in north London.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What should have been an occasion for celebration &ndash; a victorious start to the Village&rsquo;s NELCL campaign against spirited newcomers Island CC &ndash; was marred by ugly scenes involving a number of senior WAGs during the post-match warm down.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Annal Retentive and captain consort Linnie Evans was sensationally shown a second yellow card just three hours into the victory revelry at the Birdcage. Mumbled protests about a &ldquo;rat&rdquo; were met with a stern rebuke from skipper Pontin, and a shamed Evans was bundled into a cab home to Think About What She Had Done.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Later, A Bomb Disposal Unit was despatched to the Dalston Jazz Barr to investigate reports of a disturbance involving Tour de Village veteran Fran Bell. Rumours that the five-time winner gave up her yellow jersey without much of a struggle are &ldquo;preposterous&rdquo;, David Beckham&rsquo;s lawyers advised her to tell us.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Though anything but level, the Springfield Park pitch was, as ever, a great leveller. Up-and-down bounce meant nobody was ever really &ldquo;in&rdquo;, and it took an undefeated anchor innings from the Bomb (52*) to see the Village through to a defendable 169-8. That the Village made it through the full 35 overs on a wretched pitch is a testament to the growing maturity in the batting lineup. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Put in under clear blue skies, Village openers Bomb and Pontin quickly realised they were playing on a total minefield and settled in for the long haul, with Pontin accumulating a nuggety 17 before trying to up the run rate and tickling a neat outswinger from Island&rsquo;s child prodigy to the keeper.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Miami Vice John Lucarotti came to the crease soon afterwards, as Father Dean Thomas was unluckily undone by an unplayable daisy-cutter first up, and the former distance runner delighted the capacity crowd with a breezy 26, including several airings of a new weapon in his armoury: the reverse cow, or cross-court smash.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The demons in the pitch really came to the party in the middle of the Village innings, threatening to stub their fags out on the carpet and vom in the plant pots by removing Richardson (Richardson), Marcus (MoB) and Saul (Gash) in quick succession, before baby-faced assassin Tom O&rsquo;Rahilihihghaughilly steadied the good ship Village, lingering for a doughty 1 while Bomb and Frank Extras put on a much needed 30-odd for the seventh wicket at the other end.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Bomb ground relentlessly on towards the VCC&rsquo;s slowest half ton to date. Not even the arrival of the Village Medical Corps with a two-and-a-half litre flagon of industrial grade Rat could distract the portly Devonian from his task of boring the youthful Islanders into giving up cricket forever, and after 33 and a half overs of tedious nurdling he finally limped over the line, punching the air, kissing his &ldquo;guns&rdquo; and raising his bat to all 360 corners of Springfield Park in celebration.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the break between innings, Bomb received a congratulatory telegram and stick of rhubarb from Boycott&rsquo;s grandmother, who said: &ldquo;That were proper batteeeng, that were, none of this swishy-swashy crash bang wallop nonsense you see nowadays&rdquo;.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">KPK Bowman hobbled the Island response from the off with a fine spell of hostile, accurate quick bowling that accounted for a useful looking opener and no.3, and when Richardson (Richardson) got one to jump, Marcus (MoB) was on hand to pouch a spliced chance. 15-3, and the Island was sinking fast.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But runs, china, were coming at a steady rate for the NELCL newcomers &ndash; a few big hits from the middle order took them well above the required rate, and it was obvious that one good partnership would see them home.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nerves were further frayed when Pontin tipped a quicker ball from KPK round the post and seam first into Andy&rsquo;s bonce, leaving the former skipper swatting away imaginary wasps for the remainder of the innings.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Fortunately d&eacute;butante Craig &ldquo;yes, another bloody journo&rdquo; Woodhouse spared the Village&rsquo;s blushes with two decisive strikes. First, he conjured up a classic Springfield Park torpedo to castle the Island&rsquo;s worryingly talented looking 15-year-old Sam, then followed up with an absolute jaffa to shift the free-scoring Shiploo. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Pontin(g) brought the openers back on to mop up the tail, which they duly did with about five overs to spare, prompting Sadler and Waldorf-esque mutterings from the boundary about &ldquo;wondering what plan B would have been&rdquo;.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Island are a talented side, and the Village can expect a much tougher game next time they meet; indeed, if this game had been played at London Fields, the shorter boundaries and more even bounce might have swung the it in Island&rsquo;s favour.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There were a number of candidates for VCC man of the match: Woodhouse for his catch and vital two-for, KPK for his searing opening spell and Graham for trying to kill Andy with the ball, but for his unbeaten 52 and two-for, the A-Bomb shades it. A cash reward has been offered to anyone who runs him out in the next match.</font></p>
