<p>Stop a villager in the street in fifty years time and whisper&nbsp;&quot;Sunday 22nd April 2007&quot; in his ear. It will provoke a toothy&nbsp;grin not&nbsp;seen since one Oliver Lloyd Morgans went to take what has become one of the most celebrated showers in history. </p>
<p>It was&nbsp;a day of firsts for many reasons.&nbsp;Graham &quot;Norton-Anti-virus&quot; Pontin was making his bow as skipper,&nbsp;with Lucarotti finally&nbsp;elevated to the role of&nbsp;Miami Vice.&nbsp;There were debutants&nbsp;in the form of&nbsp;Paul &quot;Bowers&quot; Bowman and &quot;Flash&quot;&nbsp;Gordon Curtis. Furthermore, the Village were playing in a new venue (Crouch End)&nbsp;and against new opposition (the Pimlico Strollers).&nbsp;Throw in a bumper crowd of village supporters&nbsp;not seen since that one time at London Fields where there was that guy with the dog chain and it was fairly obvious that everyone was pumped for the season-opener.</p>
<p>Pontin&nbsp;contrived to&nbsp;lose the toss and Big Gav from the strollers took the brave decision of unleashing Bomb and Pontin by putting the village into bat. Al Bombese had clearly benefited from avoiding Sunday nets at Vicky Park and looked cultured from the start with a couple of nice shots for four&nbsp;through some&nbsp;admittedly laboured Strollers fielding. The Anti-virus, on the other hand, found&nbsp;the going a little harder&nbsp;as he entered the latest round of the&nbsp;Sunday black-eye challenge by taking one in the helmet that, quote, &quot;got up a bit&quot;.&nbsp;GP did subsequently&nbsp;make amends by hitting some boundaries and more than&nbsp;played his part in the Village making a very respectable opening stand of 117 in about 18 overs.</p>
<p>It had become clear, though, that this was a&nbsp;ground where the unvillage-like total of 300 was eminently possible so there was a need to press on. Consequently&nbsp;&nbsp;Pontin and then soon after&nbsp;Strobes departed when the opposition embarked upon the cunning&nbsp;tactic of bowling at the stumps. The bars emptied and in came the&nbsp;talismanic MMJL to&nbsp;show&nbsp;Bomb how to&nbsp;pick up the pace with a blistering knock of 28 off about 10 balls, achieved by hitting the ball in exactly the same place on about 6 or 7 different occasions. But as night follows day and the Lords Coach follows DI, the vice-captain's stumps were soon rearranged leading to the enticing prospect of the A and H Bomb combo. Unfortunately for the Village's most improved batsman he departed swiftly for a duck so it was left to McClarence to pick up where Lucarotti left off with some hearty&nbsp;sixes which resulted in a&nbsp;lost ball and a strollers bowler leaving the field for some emergency treatment to his fingers. Richardson&nbsp;finally departed on or about 50 having been put down by about 5 strollers, the final straw being sub fielder Ireland&nbsp;so obviously dropping him on purpose that the Big Man took the moral high ground and walked off in disgust,&nbsp;curtailing an otherwise&nbsp;glorious innings.</p>
<p>After a golden duck for kiwi paul, the focus then fell back on the Bomb and he delighted the Village faithful by displaying some extreme showmanship in waiting until the last ball of the innings to bring up his maiden ton with a huge six into the grateful crowd. At the other end Deano had swiftly departed whilst Maverick was more than prepared to play the role of Sid Little to Bomb's Eddie Large. The village innings ended on the useful total of 280 with a stroller heard to mutter &quot;those guys were pumped.&quot;</p>
<p>Maverick opened the bowling for the village and delivered almost instantaneously with a jaffer that was&nbsp;expertly taken by Paul somewhere between third man and gully. Another stroller's stumps were then uprooted&nbsp;with a DI yorker and the sounds of a middle-aged man grunting in pleasure all the way from St John's Wood were audible in Crouch End.&nbsp;Kiwi Paul provided able support for Mav with a very tidy first spell and the Strollers were finding it tough going.&nbsp;Al Bombese was then launched into the attack and after a couple of looseners soon found his length taking the next wicket with a generous LBW decision from the Strollers umpire. (Generous in that it was an LBW decision - it was hitting the stumps).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flash then&nbsp;eased into his Village&nbsp;debut with a couple of useful overs which stemmed the flow of Strollers runs but it was&nbsp;Richardson who responded to the calls of &quot;Leverock&quot;&nbsp;from the crowd by bowling an incredible&nbsp;14-ball over which added two further victims. In spite of the cascade of wickets the Strollers had&nbsp;somehow developed the&nbsp;belief that ten an over was not beyond them and Matt &quot; the Cat&quot; Morgan spearheaded this unlikely chase with a couple of genuine shots though the covers which kept things interesting.&nbsp;With a flagrant disrespect for good honest play the Village's antipodean duo peppered&nbsp;Matt's midriff with some eye-watering balls to the extent that there was visible relief in his face when he was finally&nbsp;run out by Pontin&nbsp;for 47. At that point it was simply a case of mopping up the tail and Paul, Deano and Mav again added to&nbsp;Procter's earlier wicket with the Village dismissing the Strollers for about 200 or so and winning by 80 runs.</p>
<p>Honourable mentions must go to&nbsp;H-Bomb Alex Hansen for his&nbsp;gazelle-like&nbsp;work in the field and Page for some good honest umpiring. Oh and I'm supposed to mention the fact that Andy thinks that MMJL throws like a girl but I don't think I will.</p>
<p>Man of the match had a number of contenders - Mav for some excellent bowling with stand-out figures of 3-15, Dwayne for an explosive performance with both bat and ball, S2H for some very fetching sandals, but in view of the fact that Village centuries are so few&nbsp;and far between there can only be one realistic&nbsp;choice and that has to be Alan&nbsp;&quot;A Bomb&quot; White with a fantastic 102 not out. Well&nbsp;done to you sir.</p>
<p>Village idiot award&nbsp;was less clear cut - There was some excellent pointless chat from the Strobester at slip, Pontin put a very takeable chance down and Mav really should have caught&nbsp;Andy out, but it was the big man himself who took the&nbsp;award by virtue of devising and expressing&nbsp;the ridiculously unconstitutional and unenforcable&nbsp;rule that the Idiot&nbsp;has to pack the kit-bag.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
