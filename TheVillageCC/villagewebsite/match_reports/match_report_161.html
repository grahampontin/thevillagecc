<conditions><p>Autumnal.</p> </conditions><p>Kiwi captain Paul Bowman led his record-breaking Village side to victory over arch-rivals London Fields then sensationally declared: &quot;I quit.&quot;<br />
The all-rounder took the final two wickets to finish with 3-18 as VCC edged to a fine win at their opponents' HQ. <br />
It was Village's ninth triumph on the bounce - and their 17th in 25 matches this season - but was KP's last as skipper as he confirmed plans to hand over the reins and return to the ranks. <br />
Whoever takes over - Indian import Eklavya Gupte is hotly tipped for the role - will inherit a team much improved by KP's three years at the helm but with a hard act to follow. <br />
The side were clearly desperate to beat Fields and give their departing leader a send off to remember. <br />
And although the 45-run margin of victory suggests it was straightforward for Village, in reality it was a much tighter game. <br />
Having lost the toss and being asked to bat, Village got off to a roaring start with ex-captain Graham Pontin and Aussie Steve Harty - also in the running to replace KP - finding the short boundaries with relative ease. <br />
But after Pontin was run out as the pair looked for a double, old VCC ways resurfaced with runs drying up and wickets falling at alarming speed.<br />
Ollie Morgans, another touted as potential skipper, made 11 before being given out caught behind - a decision which angered the Welshman who insisted it clipped his shirt not his bat.<br />
Marcus Littlejohns found the boundary four times for his 16 before falling to Sanders, who also ended Harty's 35-run innings with a peach and found his way through Alan White's defences too. And when Ahmed Ilyas was farcically run out with KP at the crease, VCC seemed sure to have thrown away their promising start.<br />
But KP and Gupte steadied the ship as Fields proved to have turned up a bowler short, and once the captain was pinned for 17 it prompted a remarkable cameo from Lukas Becker.<br />
The ball went to all corners of the park as Gupte (eventually out for 30) and Becker (who finished unbeaten on 27), added vital late runs to drag VCC over the 200 line.<br />
Fields were confident of victory at the break but KP made early inroads, bowling opener Theys for a duck, and man-of-the-match Becker weighed in to remove batsmen three and four.<br />
Economical bowling was also keeping Fields behind the rate, though wicket-keeper batsman Lord and eventual half-centurion Isaac threatened to spoil KP's victory party.<br />
Once Gupte bowled Lord with his first ball - which came down with snow on it to rearrange the unbeliveing batsman's furniture - the spinner combined with Craig Woodhouse (3-34, with two dropped caught-and-bowled chances) to rip out the middle order and push the required rate above 10 an over.<br />
With the dangerous Isaac still at the crease, Captain Bowman brought himself back into the attack and soon wrapped up a memorable season by clean bowling the number 10 and repeating the feat on the top scorer.<br />
A guard of honour greeted KP as he left the field, followed by a presentation and the news Villagers had been expecting.<br />
&quot;It's been a great three years, but I've had enough,&quot; the Kiwi said.<br />
&quot;I'm looking forward to just playing, and taking some holidays.&quot;</p>
