<p class="MsoNormal">MARATHON MAN ON FIRE AS VCC RUN JMS RAGGED</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Ex-Ex Marathon Man John Lucarotti recorded his maiden 50 for the VCC yesterday, as Bun Hampton stoked up the heat on his competitors in the bowler of the year competition.</b><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><o:p></o:p></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">PHEW WHAT A SCORCHER!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It was quite hot, but not that hot.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">IF THERE&rsquo;S GRASS ON THE WICKET, IT&rsquo;S TIME TO PLAY CRICKET, SAYS HAMPTON!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The pitch wasn&rsquo;t quite as bad as it normally is up there, though it was very green so there was plenty of movement off the seam, and the damp surface gave the spinners some assistance too. Tarquin and Red Shorts marched out to face the music, and within a couple of overs Hindle was back in the hutch, turning his wrists too early on one that stopped and popping up a leading edge to one of the close fielders. Troja looked in no trouble at all, however, and played sensibly against the new ball.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">IT&rsquo;S LUCA WOT WON IT!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At the other end XXMMJL had arrived, and took a slightly different approach, spanking the bowlers in time-honoured fashion through the leg side. The Minshallmen posted a deep mid-wicket (another two deep-midwickets would have been an idea), but Lucarotti wasn&rsquo;t in the least concerned, continuing to score at well over a run a ball.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The arrival of a slow dibbly-dobbly into the attack lead many spectators to conclude that the entertainment for the day was about to end, but Luca continued his serene progress.&nbsp;Troja was also hitting his stride, playing trademark deft late cuts and driving the bowlers elegantly when they overpitched. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Lucarotti reached his first VCC 50 in the blink of an eye, an innings many thought would never see the light of day. Both batsmen reached the milestone in an honourable manner &ndash; spanking a colossal six (eds, pls check this).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">WOULD THE LAST PERSON TO WATCH AB BAT PLEASE TURN OUT THE LIGHTS?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Captain Harty&rsquo;s bold &lsquo;declare at 50&rsquo; policy, not apparently instigated in a bid to keep the other Antipodean&rsquo;s average down, meant that soon the pair were on their way and replaced by the Skipper and AB. Neither batsman was middling the ball particularly well, but some erratic second string bowling kept the run rate well above 6 an over. Harty smeared two full tosses for six at the start of his innings, and AB was working the spinner around nicely.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">HARSH BUT FAIR!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It was at this point that controversy came, as one of the fielders took exception to Tarka&rsquo;s slightly overzealous widing of one of the bowlers. The exchange culminated in the fielder telling him not to be a &lsquo;tw@t&rsquo; and Tarka telling him he was out of order and ordering him to leave the field of play in the manner of an overzealous Victorian school teacher. Fortunately the captains quickly settled the argument, with the conclusion reached that both parties had a point, especially on the whole female genitalia thing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">THE WHEELS COME OFF!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Steve reached his 50 with another pair of sixes, and with AB scoring at a decent rate it looked like 300 was an outside possibility &ndash; after 30 overs we were 230/3. Or possibly for 1, depending on how you see it. AB&rsquo;s first 31 runs had taken just over a run a ball. The next seven took him four overs, as he frantically attempted to mow everything for six, missed or nicked pretty much all of them, and finally, to mounting hilarity from square leg umpire MMJL, sponged one up in the air. Fortunately Becker was making a swift 19 at the other end while this was going on, hammering the spinner through and over mid-wicket.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">GOTCHA!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Becker went, and what followed was carnage. The lower order attempted to accelerate, but lost all their wickets in a bid to up the rate. Six fell for the addition of 14 runs from the bat. Hilarious as it was, kudos should go to the Minshallmen for keeping up the accuracy at the end of the innings, especially the seamer Lewis, who bowled particularly well. The lower order collapse brought Troja and a delighted Lucarotti back for a few more balls at the end, thus grabbing them some well-deserved red ink.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">COULDN&rsquo;T CATCH A COLD!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Bun opened up the second innings with a fiery spell, and straight away there was some excellent Village action in the slips. First AB dropped one by his bootlaces at second, then one flew between first and second slip, then the slips were rejigged and one went between second and third, and finally Bun decided to dispense with the slips altogether and bowled both the openers, which was probably the most sensible policy. At the other end Matty was bowling a good spell and had a couple of very close shouts for stumpings. Very close. Meanwhile the assembled Villagers were busily working out new nicknames for Bun, the winner among the team's Asian contingent being 'Bunchod'. We might stick with that.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">JESUS H CHRIST!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Up stepped the Risen Christ from the Hampstead Way end, with a superb spell of flight and guile. Three middle order players were beaten by a combination of nagging accuracy and surprising quicker ones. Ahmed took a cracking catch behind off one of the latter deliveries. At the other end Eklavya was giving little away, and having experienced his new doosra at first hand on the practise pitch this scribe would like to report that it really is very good indeed. This was possibly the ball that did for the number seven, though like all good spinners the Example never gives away his secrets. He could have had another one, had butterfingers Bomb not attempted a second chance with a volleyball spike to a ball whacked out to him at deep midwicket. Sadly at around this point the 25-over chat vortex appeared and having disappeared into the Banter Black hole this scribe has little to report.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">ALL OVER BAR THE SHOUTING!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Bun returned and grabbed two in two, but Blake saw out the hat-trick ball and went on to bring up an excellent 50, looking far more at home against the turning ball than his team mates. However, it was the man who&rsquo;d started the day badly who wrapped things up, Tarka&rsquo;s skiddy medium pace trapping Blake and the number 11 to finish the job. Cue photos and falling over, before a trip to a poncy gastro pub up miles away from the ground up a very steep hill, and much booze.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">MoM: Many contenders, but for his maiden 50 after 6 years of trying, MMJL.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Village idiot: AB, for a great many reasons.</p>
