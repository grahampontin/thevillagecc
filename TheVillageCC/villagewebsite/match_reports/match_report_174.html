<div style="line-height: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div style="line-height: normal"><span style="font-size: 12pt">With summer just around corner, the weather was a little chilly on this bank holiday Sunday.&nbsp;There was some sun, wind and quite a few white clouds streaking past overhead.</span></div> </conditions><p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;The Villages 'record-breaking' run of sixteen back-to-back victories had just been cruelly ended the previous day, the Village losing by 10 wickets, a very modest total knocked off by a &lsquo;Rampant&rsquo; Rampant Badgers side that needed just the 9 overs complete their victory.&nbsp;Previously unbeaten rookie captain Eklavya had scrapped together a bits and pieces side for the encounter, with many reliable regulars noticeably absent. &nbsp;Today Eklavya was understandably keen to get the Village juggernaut back on track, so to speak.&nbsp;He told his charges as much in the pre match team talk.&nbsp;After losing the toss, the opposition kindly asked the Village to have a bat.&nbsp;Tony had some difficulty getting his keys into the pitch during the televised pitch report.&nbsp;Tony managed to dislodge a chunk of turf just on a good length, however, he did replace the piece of turf and was heard to say &lsquo;no one will even notice&rsquo;. &nbsp;Tony commented that the pitch had a liberal amount of browned off cluster type grass and was hardly what you would consider a road.&nbsp;He went on the say the overnight rain and cloud cover may offer some assistance to the bowlers early on.</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 12pt">With the regular openers absent Will Hayles and Adam Simson strode out purposefully to the crease.&nbsp;The opening bowlers were charging in and extracting bounce, variable bounce.&nbsp;The openers didn't last long with the conditions favouring the bowling side in the early exchanges. &nbsp;Naz joined Victorian Steve Harty at the crease and pair set about consolidating on what was a fairly tenuous position. &nbsp;The pair put on a fifty run stand before Naz was out caught, just as he was looking comfortable.&nbsp;An Australian duo were together at the crease now, with former Victorian Troja joining Harty out in the centre.&nbsp;At this key stage of the game the pair complied over 50 runs, with Harty the more aggressive and Troja playing more of a watchful anchor role.&nbsp;When Victorian Harty was dismissed going after another boundary six, making a well constructed 69, a flurry of Village wickets followed, with a plethora of single figure scores.&nbsp;The pitch was playing some tricks and there were one or two sporting LBWs decisions against the batting side.&nbsp;Troja remained unbeaten on 34 at the fall of the tenth wicket and after 35 overs the Village had amassed 179.&nbsp;Even bearing in mind the pitch wasn&rsquo;t ideal, the total felt around twenty shy of par in a 40 over fixture. </span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 12pt">The Village opened the bowling with Lyneham and Hampton (only allowed to participate after a charge of high treason was dropped in the morning).&nbsp;Ply is renowned for sacrificing accuracy for pace and basically revelling in scaring the living shite out of batsman.&nbsp;Today Ply was different, realising that full and straight was the order of the day.&nbsp;He was rewarded with three wickets in his opening spell, including 'catch of season' by not out batsman Troja, really a marvellous effort that.&nbsp;At the other end Bun was economical and beat the bat regularly, but, as has been the case more than once this season was unsuccessful in his opening spell.&nbsp;The first change bowlers Woodhouse and Eklavya continued to keep the batsman under pressure and the runs in check, the Louse was particularly miserly early and certainly unlucky not get one or two wickets (indeed showing some frustration when he spilled a catch off his own bowling and suggested a nearby fieldsman was partly responsible for shouting catch too loudly).&nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 12pt">Eklavya&rsquo;s first couple of overs kept the batsman guessing and induced a run out.&nbsp;After completing four overs he brought on Francis as his replacement.&nbsp;At this crucial moment in the game Eddy delivered for his side taking key wickets in his first and third overs.&nbsp;After toiling away at the other end the Louse had bowled his compliment and Bun was brought back on.&nbsp;Around fifty needed off 15 overs at this stage.&nbsp;Harty replaced Eddy at the other end and it felt like you could cut the tension with a knife out there.&nbsp;The crowd was building up at the boundaries edge and the batting team had only the three wickets in reserve.&nbsp;Bun continued to be economical and following another tremendous catch from Troja snared a wicket.&nbsp;Harty was bowling nicely at the other end and Ply came back into the fray looking to try and blast out the lower order.&nbsp;However, it was the Victorian Harty who was rewarded with a wicket following some tight at the death bowling.&nbsp;The game ebbed and flowed, it also flowed and ebbed, so to speak.&nbsp;With only 2 or 3 overs remaining the tension was raised just that little bit further when on his Village keeping debut Adam could only watch on as the as the ball kept low and sailed past to strike the spare helmet situated directly behind him, resulting in five penalty runs.&nbsp;It's worth mentioning that other than this slip up the keeper performed very well on a difficult track.</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 12pt">With around 12 runs needed off 15 balls the crowd were at fever pitch, the tension and the drama were all palpable out there in the middle of the pitch. &nbsp;At the death bowler Harty was fired up following a controversial offside wide decision.&nbsp;Surrounded by excited fans and perhaps just thinking the game was just slipping out of the Villages reach, Harty was under pressure (as were the entire Village side and on the boundaries edge a mildly drunk homeless old timer who believed he was watching Surrey vs. Hampshire, he was of course mistaken, but, certainly not too wide of the mark in terms of the high drama and tension unfolding). &nbsp;Every run took on a special importance and this game was going down to the wire.&nbsp;When Harty was called (rather late) for another dubious offside wide by an umpire also feeling the pressure, he snapped, so to speak.&nbsp;The ensuing pumped up response, which included a suggestion a new umpire was provided and the previous decision overturned may have been slightly over the top.&nbsp;The following couple minutes of &lsquo;banter&rsquo; saw the bowlers wishes granted.&nbsp;This commentator was not in an ideal position to see the 'wide', but, it appeared to be a legitimate delivery, at this level anyway (the old timer on the boundaries edge may of course disagree).&nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 12pt">The game continued with Victorian Harty again charging in.&nbsp;Immediately the batsman popped the ball up to mid off, the fieldsman (as has been case more than once this season) unluckily dropped a regulation chance (or completed a reverse catch as its known these days).&nbsp;The Village were probably outsiders at this stage (had mid off just dropped the world cup?).&nbsp;The captain bowled himself in the penultimate over and kept his side right in the game.&nbsp;When Harty returned for the final over, the batting side needed five to win with just the one wicket in hand.&nbsp;He continued to bowl well and three runs were needed to win off the last ball.&nbsp;The batsman drove a full pitched delivery straight down the ground and set off. &nbsp;Needing 2 to salvage a draw, the batsmen turned for a second just as fielder Bilal had his hands on the ball out there on the deep mid on boundary.&nbsp;The throw needed to be good and it was a great throw, one bounce over the stumps to Victorian Harty, who whipped the balls off to complete a marvellous one run victory.&nbsp;The crowd went wild, really a tremendous effort that, everything you could ask for really, tension, drama and excitement.</span></div>
