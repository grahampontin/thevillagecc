<conditions><p>A good pitch becoming a mud bath due to constant heavy showers.</p> </conditions><p>&nbsp;The Village vs Rain Men</p>
<p><em>by Tarquin Tardus</em></p>
<p>Having already lost us a fixture due to the fact that some oppositions can't bear to be told the TRUTH, I was surprised and overjoyed when the call came for me to provide another. Admittedly I wasn't at the game in question and was in fact following it on the Village's twitter feed and through text message updates, but as the committee told me: 'Don't worry, you'll probably end up giving a more balanced account than normal.'</p>
<p>Now the Rain Men have been our perennial opponents for many years. In that time we have improved a great deal as a team: they, it's fair to say, have remained somewhat stationary. I myself have a personal axe to grind with them. I forget the details but I seem to remember one of their bowlers sent down a beamer which hit me on the head and rather than being no-balled he then won an LBW shout. Oh yes, very funny. Laugh it up. Sachin Tendulkar's only 4'9 or something like that.</p>
<p>To the wicket then, marched Steve Harty and Lukas Becker, to face the opening attack of Odwell and White. I may have commented on Steve's batting before - and will further down this piece.</p>
<p>Only the other day I was commenting on one of James Delingpole's excellent blog posts about so-called 'climate change' when a thought occured to me: is Lukas the best batsman I have ever seen? The subtle caresses of his extra cover strokes have often set my heart-a flutter, and while he has selflessly put himself down the order on occasion he has never let his side down when runs have been needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, he was soon castled by Odwell, a lumbering bear of a man whose physique reminded me of many I met in my younger days when I would stay out late and invariably find myself at 4am dancing to hardcore grind in the fleshpots of Soho and Vauxhall. Indeed, both he and White had maintained a miserly level of accuracy throughout the opening exchanges, with neither conceding more than 3 an over.&nbsp;However, the arrival of the number three sped up the run rate considerably.</p>
<p>Only the other day I was on a Liberty and Livelihood march in support of culling badgers and people from Islington when a thought occured to me: is Oliver Morgans the best batsman I have ever seen? While his technique is far from classical and he is a nervous starter to say the least, the sheer brute power of some of his off side play has often stood up the hairs on the back of my neck, among other body parts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suffice to say he started nervously, dropped at slip and playing and missing with some regularity. However, the rain began to pour, and as the ball got wet both Odwell and White lost the control they had at the start. Morgans took full toll of some full tosses from White - four overs for nine became five overs for 22. It was a harsh end to what had been an excellent spell, but the callous efficiency had me salivating for more. At the other end, meanwhile...</p>
<p>Only the other day I was writing to Gideon Osborne to commend him on the marvellous job he has been doing with Britain's economy when a thought occured to me: is Steve Harty the greatest batsman I have ever seen? I have never seen a batsman flay a struggling attack with such timing and precision. With the Rain Men off spinner struggling to grip the ball, Steve went about demolishing the bowling. His lofted extra-cover drives were a joy to behold. What was most impressive was that Steve was scoring these runs in between a huge number of rain delays. I believe we were on and off the pitch six or seven times in total, and while the damp conditions were little help to the fielding side, his capacity to sustain his concentration never ceases to amaze me.</p>
<p>An early tea was taken, and some of our more proletarian members watched the football on television. With sandwiches, pasta and chocolate cake all available the North Middx CC caterers are to be commended.</p>
<p>Upon the resumption Oliver was scoring in the only way he knows how - with corruscating off side shots and occasional, Pietersen-esque flicks through mid-wicket from outside off stump. He had certainly turned it, and me, on. Steve cruised to his 50 and very kindly retired himself so as to give others a go. This brought to the wicket one Nicholas Troja.</p>
<p>Only the other day I was pushing some dog poo through a Labour councillor's letter box &nbsp;when a thought occured to me: is Nick Troja the best batsman I have ever seen? Sadly today's effort suggested otherwise: castled for 9 by a nipping delivery from perennial VCC tormentor Cooper. This brought David Ireland to the crease.</p>
<p>Only the other day I was&nbsp;posting as 'Bun' on the Guestbook when a thought occured to me: is David Ireland the only Royal we have ever had playing for the Village? And if so, why on earth can't we have more? Presumably this is down to those looney republican Hackneyites who set the thing up in the first place. Anyway, between more rain delays he and Morgans turned the screw, with David proving that a future career as a batsman is far from beyond him, and Oliver top-edging an ungainly hoick over the shortest boundary off a ludicruously slow, short ball to bring up the first six he has and ever will hit.</p>
<p>Stephen declared, leaving the Rain Men a 175 target in 35 overs. Now, some notes on this, in answer to some of the complaints we have heard re. the declaration: 1) With the exception of AB, no one on that side averages over 25. 2) They have won only one game this season, and had to travel hundreds of miles to do so. 3) Only a couple of weeks ago AB had watched them fail to get anywhere near&nbsp;<u>exactly&nbsp;</u>the same target, against a far inferior team.</p>
<p>The declaration was sporting. Enough.&nbsp;AB and opener Neil strode to the wicket.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only the other day I was making love when a thought occured to me: is AB the greatest batsman I have ever seen? When I watch his thunderous pull strokes and sweetly-timed extra cover drives I find my loins ablaze at the sight of such a stirring figure of masculinity, but there remains a sweet air of vulnerability about his defensive technique. Sadly my wife-to-be refused to engage me in conversation on the topic.</p>
<p>Openers Bin and CMoN started a little loosely, and soon the Rain Men were closing in on 50 without a wicket having fallen, and at a quicker rate than we had managed. Well, here was a turn up for the books. Fortunately, the Kiwi pairing of newly-introduced Boa and Bin put some pressure on them - Matt took the first wicket, opener Neil trapped on the back pad in front of middle, before Bun smashed his way through the middle order, with three clinical strikes thanks to some pacy yorkers. At one point he was on a hat-trick. The bowler of the year contest is certainly hotting up, and I for one would not like to be the judge.</p>
<p>The game hinged on a moment of controversy: a huge shout for caught-behind off number 6 Cooper. Umpire thought not out. Batsman didn't walk. His team thought he'd edged it, and didn't applaud the 50 he subsequently made. AB has written an apologetic email which I feel it would be remiss not to reproduce in full:</p>
<p><em>Dear Village</em></p>
<p><em>Sorry about that. Now you know how it feels.</em></p>
<p><em>Yours,</em></p>
<p><em>AB</em></p>
<p><em>p.s. Haha!</em></p>
<p>I think it tells you a great deal about the man that he can be so contrite in such controversial circumstances.</p>
<p>Anyway, there is little more of this tale to tell. Debutant Kennedy bowled well and fielded superbly and we hope to see more of him. The Rain Men somehow stumbled over the line to record only their second win of the season. In the end there is little reason for the VCC to feel down: unlike most teams in London, we actually got a game, and it was a close one. Only the other day I was leaving threatening voicemails on George Monbiot's mobile phone when a thought struck me: cricket is a very strange game indeed.</p>
<p>Man of the Match: Odd to give this to the man on the losing side, but there can only be one. Could probably have scored a double hundred but chose to give other people a go, could have set a harder target but chose to fashion a close game, carried himself with dignity and and class throughout. Step forward, Stephen Harty.</p>
<p>Village idiot: The VCC have lost two matches this year. This man has been the common factor: David Ireland.</p>
