<conditions><p>After 10 years of playing on council pitches and the occasional paddock (Broughton Gifford &amp; Hampstead Heath Extension come to mind), the Village CC were cordially invited to play at the Honourable Artillery Company's landmark cricket ground at Armoury House.</p>
<p>Located within London's Square Mile, the Artillery Ground can be found on maps dating back to 1677.&nbsp; Originally used for archery practice, cricket has been played on this ground as early as 1725.</p>
<p>You may be wondering how the Village came to be playing at such an esteemed venue. Back in 2009 the Village did a joint tour to Malta with the Further Friars.&nbsp; Chris Tanous, a long standing Further Friar and HAC committee member, was introduced to Steve Harty by VCC skipper Paul Bowman. Chris invited Steve to join the HAC playing list, and over the course of the 2010 season Steve got several Villagers into play for HAC, including one Alan White.</p>
<p>Alan had an immediate impact at HAC and found himself opening the batting and bowling at some of HAC's marquee fixtures. After a particularly trying innings against Hong Kong CC, Alan put the hard word on the HAC fixtures secretary for a HAC v Village CC match. As they say, the rest is history. Thanks Bomb!</p> </conditions><p>Skipper Troja was off to a flying start Saturday, first convincing the HAC skipper to play 40 overs instead of Declaration, and then winning the toss and electing to bat. The match pitch was near the edge of the square, creating a short boundary and bringing office windows within reach.&nbsp; The wicket was so hard that Pitcher thought he was standing on the M1. The stage was set of a high scoring affair!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The brothers De Mellow opened proceedings, and right from the outset Toby was particularly severe on the medium pace offerings from HAC.&nbsp; A cut behind square for four on only the 2nd ball of the day set the tone.&nbsp; With the score racing along at near 10 per over HAC skipper Ed Haines brought himself on and immediately made an impact sneaking one through TdM's defences.</p>
<p>Harty continued on where TdM left off and before long HAC had switched to spin at both ends. HAC star Parry removed Harty, bringing Pontin to the wicket to steady the ship. JdM followed not long after, and at 83/3 off just 12 overs the Village innings was starting to wobble. Enter Chris Donald. Chris and Graham started to build a partnership, rotating the strike and still despatching anything loose. Initially Chris was the more aggressive of the two, bringing up his 50 first, followed by Graham a few overs later.&nbsp; At this point Potty was clearly seeing the ball like a basketball and hit 6 fours in the 8 balls after bring up his 50, including 4 in a row. Graham eventually holed out for 76 in the 35th over, bringing a memorable 150 run partnership to a close.</p>
<p>Then in a tribute to the VCC of old, a Village mini collapse ensued. VCC skip Troja came and went quickly looking for fast runs, Chris &quot;Magnifique&quot; Donald was caught on the boundary for a well-made 67, and Naz was bowled first ball by Fletcher with one that nipped back in.&nbsp; EK survived a massive LBW appeal on the hat-trick ball, but went on to bat beautifully for 25 not out, ably supported by Prash who did an excellent job rotating the strike.</p>
<p>In the end 282/7 off 40 overs.&nbsp; A marvellous effort that. One of the highest VCC scores on record and probably a good 20 runs above par (IMHO).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following a pleasant afternoon tea in the HAC marquee, HAC embarked on the imposing run chase. Thommo and Naz got the new ball honours and bowled well at HAC stalwart Liam Casey and his partner Dews.&nbsp; Despite some disciplined Village bowling and near flawless display of ground fielding, Village were unable to create an early chance and the HAC innings gradually gained momentum. TdM and Pitcher came into the attack and Casey started to show his class and poise by stroking elegant drives through the off-side field and flicking anything short from TdM to or over the square-leg boundary.</p>
<p>With just 2 overs to drinks HAC were looking dangerous on 85/0.&nbsp; TdM continued to steam in from the Armoury House end and was finally rewarded with Dews hitting one straight to EK at mid-off. Drinks were taken and VCC skipper took the opportunity to remind his charges that HAC needed close to 200 runs to win, but that we had key wickets to take.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the drinks break Casey continued to accelerate until the scoreboard pressure finally forced a false stroke off the bowling of Troja, with Pontin taking a solid catch from a hard flat pull-shot on the mid-wicket boundary.&nbsp; The very next over HAC number 3 Arnold hit one in the air straight to Harty at mid-off, and the Village started to sense that Mr. Streak may yet make an appearance.</p>
<p>However HAC's Sean Parry had other ideas. Parry, with a 1st class appearance to his name, came into the game with big wraps and didn't fail to deliver. He treated the 100+ strong crowd (including the wedding reception) to a tremendous display of controlled hitting. Parry was particularly fierce on anything on his pads, but equally comfortable launching drives straight down the ground.</p>
<p>As it became obvious that we could not contain Sean, the Village attempted to frustrate him out by pushing the field back to get him off strike. This brought HAC 3 wickets, as Parry did all he could to keep the strike, resulting in Henry Faj, Ed Jones and Ed Haines all being run out. Special mention should be made of the Ed Jones run out, firstly since Ed was batting with a runner, and secondly because of Chris Pitcher's incredible pick-up throw and direct hit from mid-on.</p>
<p>Thus with 7 overs to go, more than 75 still required, danger man Parry launch one of the most brutal batting attacks seen by the Village, even eclipsing the Ross Haines exploits in Oxford in 2013.&nbsp; Sean hit 46 in two overs off quality (ginger) bowling.&nbsp; Meanwhile at the other end EK and Naz claimed 3 more wickets, all bowled. Leaving the equation at 9 down and 20 to get off the last 3 overs.</p>
<p>HAC ended up reaching the target with 7 balls to spare, with Parry left tantalisingly short of his century on 94 not out.</p>
<p>In summary, it was simply a great match, played in good competitive spirit by two well matched teams. Your correspondent, a long term Villager, was enormously proud of VCC's performance on Saturday, not only in terms of the on-field disciplines of batting, bowling and fielding, but most importantly with the character and spirit in which the game was played.</p>
