<div align="center"><span style="font-size: 8pt">Pyrford, Monday 4<sup>th</sup> May 2009</span></div>
<div align="center">&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">It was the best of performances; it was the worst of performances: the excellent contributions of our antipodean contingent eclipsing the damp squib that was the efforts of our home grown stars.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b><span style="font-size: 10pt">Part One: </span></b><b><span style="font-size: 10pt">Rich&rsquo;s Story</span></b></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">The day began with promise. Blue skies and sunshine greeted the Village&rsquo;s intrepid Monday XI upon their awakening, fortifying them for the lengthy trek beyond the M25 and into the unknown land of Pyrford for the first of Bomb&rsquo;s much vaunted &ldquo;red-light&rdquo; fixtures. These, it should be noted, are fixtures of difficulty, not those taking place in Soho after hours.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">By the time our weary travellers had arrived in what turned out to be a really rather nice village-come-small-town the weather had closed in, the rain had begun and Fran Bell had already decided to take a train back to London. It wasn&rsquo;t all doom and gloom though; there was a nice club house, a proper scorers hut and DI had managed to arrive on time.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">As it turned out, the rain began to ease and not long after having fully assembled at the ground KP was out in the middle hoping to carry on his good run of form with the coin. It seemed like a must-win toss: a damp, green wicket, rain in the air and a strong Village bowling line up were all screaming &ldquo;have a bowl&rdquo; and so KP duly won the toss and elected to bat, much the surprise of his team mates and the consternation of his top order.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">That top order was at least boosted by the presence of specially recruited antipodean ringer, Rich, who KP assured us would be more than capable of facing up to a bowling attack advertised as &ldquo;all as quick as P-Ly&rdquo;.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">And so to the wicket marched the Village&rsquo;s opening pair of Pontin and Rich looking to get the innings off to a solid start. Let us not forget that to this point in the season the Village&rsquo;s batting has looked uncharacteristically solid: only 6 wickets had fallen in the previous 2 innings combined. </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">The first over passed without much alarm, Pontin nudging a couple round the corner and then grabbing a single off the 5<sup>th</sup> ball to bring new boy Rich on strike.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">In the pre-match build up Rich had declared that he was the kind of batsman that &ldquo;came out swinging&rdquo; and he was not to disappoint. Greeted by a bouncer, he promptly rocked back and had a massive swish at fresh air much to the bowler and wicket keeper&rsquo;s delight. Their delight was however replaced with a quite different emotion as Rich casually ambled down the track to apologise to his batting partner: &ldquo;Sorry mate, I was expecting that to be a lot quicker&rdquo;. Strike one to the Aussie.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">The batting pair&rsquo;s glee at this slight was to be short lived though, an unconvincing Chinese cut off the final ball of the following over was enough for Pontin to steal the strike, which, given his batting partner&rsquo;s eventual contribution was probably a foolish move. A couple of deliveries later and Pontin was walking &ndash; dismissed for the first time by a &ldquo;plan&rdquo; &ndash; a short ball into the ribs fended to the man waiting under the helmet at short leg for a disappointing four.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">Come to the wicket a typically vigilant A Bomb. And vigilance was all that was really required. Rich was still swinging, only now he was hitting it, to all corners. The short uphill boundary chosen to take the worst of the abuse.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">Bomb was finally unseated for a dogged 1 by a ball that spat at him from outside off stump, taking the shoulder of the bat and just carrying to the man at second slip. This was real cricket and the Village sensed they were up against it.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">Morgs and Marrow then came and went. Morgs contribution of three was courtesy of overthrows but he at least hung around long enough to see the end of the opening pair and the beginning of the spinners. Sadly, by the time Marrow had played round a straight one for a duck the Village were 55-4 and in deep trouble. Thoughts of the collapses of old were in mind and the occupants of newly christened Chat Shed were fearing the worst.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">A glimmer of hope remained. Of those opening 55 runs the four dismissed batsmen had contributed just 8 runs. Rich was still smiting boundaries for fun and given the conditions the Village were hopeful he could lead them to some kind of respectability.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">By this stage in proceedings DI &ldquo;Village&rsquo;s most incapable scorer&rdquo; had been ejected from the Chat Shed nee scorers&rsquo; hut having failed to fill in any of the required information beyond the score, P-Ly was only narrowly refrained from defacing his copy of Handel as punishment on the grounds it was the property of a public institution.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">Marrow and Pontin decided to make themselves useful by trying to get to grips with the myriad of cogs, wheels, pull cords and number plates that make up a proper scoring hut. Their success was limited it must be said, but as Rich approached a ton on his maiden Village appearance they well into the swing of things.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">Rich&rsquo;s foil in his push to three figures came from an uncharacteristically well balanced knock from Skipper Bowman. An excellent mixture of solid defence and simple shots brought him a very commendable 25 featuring only one four and one maximum. Shortly before he could complete his task however he was cleaned up by Hedges while looking to block. A lapse in concentration perhaps, and an unfitting end to very fine innings.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">Cue the arrival at the crease of our third and final antipodean, P-Ly. And he was in no mood to hang around. A blistering 45 not out featuring 5 fours and 2 sixes looked to be guiding the Village towards, not only respectability but a competitive total.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">In the mean time Rich reached the magical three figures, 2 sixes over long-on enough for him to all but skip the nervous nineties. It should be noted that first of these pierced the hands of the waiting deep long-on fielder and bounced off the top of his head over the rope but the scorebook still reads: R Alexander 112, and that is all that will be remembered.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">He was eventually skittled by returning opening bowler Keyworth, one swing too many proving his undoing. But his contribution was a telling one. P-Ly accompanied an ever elegant DI (1) caught off a text-book off-drive, a dogged Pimllott (8) and a short lived Francis (0) to a thoroughly impressive and not a little surprising 233 all out (we only had ten players, for those of you paying attention).</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">Of that 233 the representatives of the homeland had contributed just 17 runs. When was it that the Aussies got so damn good at this game?</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b><span style="font-size: 10pt">Part Two: Hedges&rsquo; Story</span></b></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">With 233 runs under their belts the Village were contented enough at the tea interval, Bomb had in fact engaged Marrow in a bet that 180 would be enough to win. Marrow, showing his leadership instincts, took the bet and in so doing backed his troops to lose. Thanks, Marrow.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">Well fed and watered the Village took to the field confident enough that they could defend their total if early inroads were made.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">The innings didn&rsquo;t get off to a great start, 10 runs off P-Ly&rsquo;s first over courtesy of 4 byes and 5 leg side wides passed an injured Pontin behind the stumps.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">From the other end DI was finding some swing, but not enough to trouble Pyrford&rsquo;s First XI opening batsman Hedges who was already making steady progress with the kind of compact, low-risk shots that spoke of a man who knows how to wield the willow.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">Success was eventually forthcoming at the other end however DI producing one of those magic balls of his to uproot Lipscombe snr&rsquo;s stumps for 16. At 50-odd for 1 Pyrford still looked well placed and the Village turned to first change pair KP and A Bomb to try and do some damage.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">A Bomb was the man to make the breakthrough, removing Lipscombe jnr for 21, DI Catching King holding on to an excellent over the shoulder catch on the run at wide long-on. Another 40 or so had been added to the total though and with Pyrford only slightly behind the run rate the Village knew they had to unseat Hedges if they wanted to win.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">KP put down probably the Village&rsquo;s best chance of dismissing him, and to say it was a chance at all is stretching things. A sharp low return catch off his own bowling that was otherwise heading for four was just too hot for the skipper&rsquo;s dropping left hand to keep hold of &ndash; painful fingers all he had to show for a committed effort.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">The skipper was to have more luck shortly after though as he helped A Bomb to remove Abbas for 2. Come to the wicket Altaf and the game&rsquo;s first moment of controversy. P-Ly was brought back into the attack in an effort to make inroads into the Pyrford middle-order and he soon had his man. Well, he should have had his man. A huge nick behind, so obvious it was hardly worth appealing for, was turned down by the umpire, and a rather sheepish looking batsman stood his ground. It&rsquo;s fair to say that the Village fielders were more than a little upset at this lack of sportsmanship though, as ever, perhaps their response was a little more severe than is strictly called for in these sorts of games.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">Still, the game was close and on such things can results turn.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">Eddie was bowling a tidy spell from the other end, 7 overs at 5 a piece were enough to keep Pyrford on track without letting them get away. The Village knew they needed Hedges out and so turned to the leg spinning arts of Aussie Ringer and first innings centurion Rich to see if he couldn&rsquo;t remove the danger man. It was an expensive gamble &ndash; 3 overs for 30 runs are perhaps the mark of a part time leg spinner, unplayable rippers mixed with a long hop or two. It was a gamble that nearly paid off though, Hedges struck on the full attempting to sweep a straight one and the Village thought they might have the crucial breakthrough. It was not to be however, missing leg was the call. Missing leg it was not, but it would have been a brave umpire who gave the 2<sup>nd</sup> innings centurion out LBW on the front foot to a somewhat erratic leg spinner.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">In the end it was a knock that turned out to be decisive: 127 not out for Hedges eclipsing the next best effort of Altaf who was eventually felled by KP, a flattened leg stump being enough to encourage the batsman to walk at the second time of asking, but not before he had made a telling 31.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">And so it was with thoughts of what could have been that the Village succumbed to their first defeat of the season, Pyrford reaching their target with 12 balls to spare. It was an excellent effort in the field from a 10 man Village unit. Bomb at Point was outstanding (yes, you read that right), catches were held and boundaries protected, but in the end this was a game very much about two batsmen: Hedges and Alexander. And their ringer didn&rsquo;t get out.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b><span style="font-size: 10pt">Awards</span></b></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">Man of the Match goes without question to Village debutant and new all time high scorer Rich for his 112 without which there would have been no total to bowl at.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">Village idiot is a tough one. DI for getting out to another elegant shot and making such an arse of the scorebook? KP for dropping their ringer on 40? In the end it has to go to one Gordon Brown for presiding over a country that has produced such a bunch of completely shoddy batsmen that they managed just 2 runs each.</span></div>
