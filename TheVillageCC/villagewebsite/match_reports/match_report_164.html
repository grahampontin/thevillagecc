<conditions><p>Terrifying: humid, emerald green, very hard. Like the Hulk after he's just seen She Hulk.</p> </conditions><p><span style="line-height: 115%; color: black; font-size: 10pt">Following on from the humping of the day before, a very different Village side</span><span style="line-height: 115%; color: black; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;took on the Rampant Badgers, (a team mostly made up of indoor cricketers), and&nbsp;they were determined&nbsp;to show the rest of the team how it should be done. We arrived at Springfield Park, and the first thing that must be said is that&nbsp;the ground remains an absolute picture. The pitch, however, looked interesting. It&rsquo;s clearly received a lot more attention than previously: not only was there an even covering of grass, it was absolutely rock hard. KP bounced a ball on the surface and nearly took it in the teeth on the rebound.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 115%; color: black; font-size: 10pt">With humid skies overhead, winning the toss and bowling seemed to be the best option, which meant that of course we lost and were inserted. Potty and I walked out to face the music, and quite some music it was. Potty faced an over from the pacy opener who sent six balls whistling past his nose from just short of a length, while my first one from formerly-accurate-but not-very-scary-mate-of-KP-Scott-Gall swung like a boomerang, spat up, and creamed me in the crackers. If ever there was a situation that needed two stodgy batsmen, this was it. The overhead conditions were making it swing, the emerald grass was providing lateral movement, the undulating pitch was making it go up and down, and Hackney council&rsquo;s attempt to improve the wicket meant it was all happening at a pace comparable with the Oval nets, or maybe Perth in 1973.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 115%; color: black; font-size: 10pt">G-Funk regularly claims batting in the top 3 is &lsquo;man cricket&rsquo;. In this instance, he probably had a point. In between playing and missing and getting smacked on the gloves, ribs, box and pretty much everywhere else, there were just a few attacking shots of any note: a cover drive and a square cut from me, and a few thumping pulls from Graham. Nevertheless, we managed to get through most of the opening spell. Rather tragically, Graham had just one over of the quick bowler to negotiate when he attempted another pull to one which kept cruelly low and bowled him &ndash; no blame can be attached to that dismissal as we had to take every half chance to score we could, since anything roughly on a length was near-unplayable, but the repercussions for the rest of the order were somewhat unfortunate, as with his remaining few deliveries the quicky took out Lucarotti with a very clever slower ball yorker, and then Parp! got in a horrible tangle facing one that really zipped away from his leg stump to hit middle and off. I gather KP's now signed him up for us.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 115%; color: black; font-size: 10pt">We were in a world of trouble here, and things went from bad to worse. Plimms went LBW for the hundredth time in the last couple of seasons, trapped bang in front to one that kept very low after walking across his stumps. Clearly there&rsquo;s a bit of technical work needed there and a change of guard might well see him back in the runs this season. KP holed out to his nemesis Scott Gall at deep slightly fine square leg (clearly the guy knows Bowman&rsquo;s game better than he does), and the Louse top edged an attempted pull to fine leg as one bounced a little extra.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 115%; color: black; font-size: 10pt">Meanwhile I was stuck at the other end, greeting and bidding farewell to the entire order. It reminded me of the VCC circa 2005/6. Finally a bit of support arrived in the form of Martin Koder, who stuck around but struggled to pick up runs in the way he&rsquo;d managed the previous day. I didn&rsquo;t get much of the strike but managed to hit a few more boundaries to bring up a 50, and a total of 124 wasn&rsquo;t so terrible given the conditions. Oddly, we took lunch with a bit of hope.<br />
<br />
KP and Lucas took the new ball, and as expected they immediately caused all sorts of problems as the wicket continued to play up. However, we were only using one ball for this game, and as it lost its hardness the uneven bounce began to ease a little.</span> <span style="line-height: 115%; color: black; font-size: 10pt">Both bowlers grabbed a wicket, Lucas taking yet another LBW with one that skidded back in, and KP&nbsp;getting one&nbsp;thanks to a stunning catch from his opening partner, who sprinted in from fine leg and heroically clung on despite Potty and Plims bearing down on him from behind the wicket.</span></p>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="line-height: 115%; color: black; font-size: 10pt">After that, sometime VCC batsman and renowned Fallopian smasher Chris Magnifique began to play a superb innings, making the pitch look far easier than it was, while at the other end captain Scott Gall was cracking the odd boundary in far less elegant but equally effective fashion. All this was to change when Chris MON came on and began to bowl his second brilliant spell in as many games. On this evidence he&rsquo;s an absolute shoo-in for most improved player (assuming he fights off&nbsp;stiff competition from P-Ly who's averaging under 50 with the ball this season). Bowling at a quicker pace than previously and more importantly making it swing like a Lib Dem back bencher, he grabbed both batsmen and added another, all beaten by huge amounts of movement. </span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="line-height: 115%; color: black; font-size: 10pt">He was backed up in great fashion by MK Don, who also bowled one of his best spells for the Village. He certainly deserved a wicket, and four overs for fifteen tells you everything you need to know about his accuracy and the defensive game to which he&rsquo;d reduced the batsmen.</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="line-height: 115%; color: black; font-size: 10pt">This was turning into one of the great Village fielding performances &ndash; we&rsquo;d hardly missed a thing, and you know the team had to be fielding well when I&nbsp;got a run&nbsp;out&nbsp;thanks to an underarm flick from cover. The contrast between this and the previous day was fascinating: despite a less talented fielding side on paper, it was far more confident of the score it had on the board.</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="line-height: 115%; color: black; font-size: 10pt">It all culminated in one of the great Village catches. We&rsquo;ve seen some blinders in our time, but this one from Parp! was of a standard he and certainly we could barely have imagined. The Louse was flicked over short midwicket for what looked like an easy couple, but the renowned Vegetablarian dived backwards and threw a hand out. I&rsquo;m still struggling to believe it stuck &ndash; the only possible better catch I can think of for the VCC might have been Potty&rsquo;s similar effort in Wiltshire, but to be honest this probably takes the gong. Simply brilliant.</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="line-height: 115%; color: black; font-size: 10pt">It was a terrific performance all in all, but it just wasn&rsquo;t quite enough. Yet again the opposition&rsquo;s number 8 and their last man managed to deny us, and we headed to the Pembury beaten but far from unbowed against a team well on the Amber side of Green. There&rsquo;s very little bad to say about our performance on the fielding side&nbsp;and it&rsquo;s highly promising to see how some of our players are developing. It was a dreadful toss to lose and had we had perhaps one more seamer in the attack we&rsquo;d have won relatively easily. Granted we didn't score many, but the new and newish ball on that wicket was a total nightmare and the wicket had a part to play in many of the dismissals.</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="line-height: 115%; color: black; font-size: 10pt">Man of the Match &ndash; We&rsquo;re all in the running, especially Lucarotti for his superb &lsquo;Come on Richard O&rsquo;Brien/Duncan Goodhew/Lee Carsley&rsquo; chat during a certain bowler&rsquo;s spell, C-Pitch bowled brilliantly, I did well, so did&nbsp;MK Don....but I&rsquo;m going to go for Parp on the back of one moment of genius, more of&nbsp;a general award to the whole fielding side perhaps.</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="line-height: 115%; color: black; font-size: 10pt">Village idiot: No idiots today. Maybe the groundsman &ndash; if he&rsquo;s reading, the pitch was better when it was covered in thick grass and very damp...</span></div>
