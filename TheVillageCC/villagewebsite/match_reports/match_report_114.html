<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="">It ended with a whimper. With The Village one run away from achieving their target of 127 to win, a looping delivery barely made it on to the cut strip. Umpire Jean-Luc Erotique was left with little choice but to call a wide, thus ending the game in a fairly unsatisfactory fashion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="">Yet the anti-climactic nature of the finale should not detract from what was a spirited and professional performance by The Village, which continued their 100% start to the season. The team was captained, for the first time, by Marcus, and his most pressing early task was to assemble his men in the leafy surroundings of Chiswick. The Civil Service Sports Ground boasted football pitches, well-manicured grass tennis courts and a sizable pavilion, as well as no fewer than four well-tended cricket pitches, the sight of which elicited low whistles of approval and mutters of &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not in Hackney any more&rdquo;. Getting to this oasis of sporting excellence in time also required careful planning, something that, not for the first time, proved beyond certain Villagers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="">So when the time came for Marcus to lose the toss and lead his team out into the field, he found his already batsman-heavy line-up was further hampered by the absence of potential opening bowler David Ireland, wily spinner Martin Koder and new recruit and unknown quantity Mark, Mate of Marcus. Still, the novice skipper was helped by the presence of an even-more-pumped-than-usual-and-therefore-dangerously-over-stimulated Louse, who had helped a handful of Villagers work up some serious dude sweat before the start. Louse duly opened the bowling and found some dangerous in-swing straight away, keeping the opposition&rsquo;s openers on their toes. He was backed up manfully by debutant Villager &lsquo;Big&rsquo; &lsquo;Uncle&rsquo; Ben Rhys Evans, who used his height to extract impressive bounce from a green pitch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="">It was first-change bowler Christophe Magnifique, however, who got the breakthrough, tempting Bishop to chip the ball straight to the newly-arrived Martin Koder. True to cricketing clich&eacute;, one brought two as some sharp fielding from Koder&rsquo;s fellow latecomer David Ireland accounted for the more dangerous of the two openers, run out for 16.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="">Wickets then began to fall regularly, with <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Ireland</st1:country-region></st1:place> replacing Uncle Ben and picking up key middle-order wickets, backed up by more sharp fielding. Koder also played his part, containing the Weasels&rsquo; batsmen and picking up a deserved wicket after some early chances went begging.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="">The Village were made to rue one mistake in particular. Number four batsman Chartrath was dropped on 3 and survived other half-chances but, after the drinks break, he began to play some expansive shots which put paid to Village dreams of keeping the score below 100. Chartrath was helped by the Weasels&rsquo; captain, who stuck to his task well, and some increasingly helpful fielding. In the end, having been held to less than 3 an over for most of their innings, the Weasels finished their allotted 35 on a respectable 126 for 7. <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ireland</st1:place></st1:country-region> took four for 27 for The Village, a fine bowling performance, while Uncle Ben returned frankly staggering figures of seven overs, three maidens, no wicket for just six runs. Props also go to the optically-enhanced Alex Hanson, who didn&rsquo;t concede a single bye in the entire innings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="">After an excellently cake-heavy tea, The Village&rsquo;s run chase got under way, with new boy Mark joining old lag Pontin in the middle. The innings started sedately enough, with only one violent forehand smash for four from Pontin to scare the horses, but then a familiar drama began to play itself out. Pontin was hit high on the pad and, after a fairly committed appeal, umpire Parper raised the smallest and most tentative of fingers. From the boundary, Louse cried out, &ldquo;It hit him in the cock!&rdquo;, but to no avail. As the realisation dawned on Pontin that he had been given out, the rage boiled over. He let fly with a volley of abuse at Parper, before stalking off, sending his bat cartwheeling across the boundary and finally lying prostrate among the old kit and uneaten mini-rolls.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="">The next man in was Erotique, keen to build on his dashing 40 of the previous week. His tenure at the crease did not last long, however, before he was undone by a ball which hit his own foot before hitting the stumps. With The Village wobbling at 11-2, the captain strode to the crease and, in the tradition of other great British leaders like Drake and Nelson, he would not leave it again until the game was won. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="">Linking up well with his buddy Mark, the two put on 111 largely untroubled runs for the third wicket. Marcus demonstrated his unerring ability to find the gaps and occasionally unfurled a square cut as elegant as Grace Kelly, while Mark mixed watchful defence with vicious attack, hitting some memorable boundaries including one mighty wallop over long-on for six.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="">Then, with his half-century in the bag and victory all but wrapped up, Mark lost his head and his wicket. With five needed to win, Ed Thomas came to the wicket with instructions from the boundary to help his skipper to a 50 of his own. Marcus need two boundaries to get there, so Ed duly blocked the last three balls of the over (obviously in other circumstances he&rsquo;s have finished the match with a six at the first opportunity). However, Marcus&rsquo; hopes of a half-century evaporated early in the next over, leaving the two batsmen little option but to pick up singles until the final extra brought victory and all its attendant joys.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="">In many ways, this game encapsulated how far The Village has come in a short time. Against decent opposition, we fielded well, bowled excellently and then overcame an early blip in our own innings to cruise home comfortably. For those of us who witnessed the shambolic performances of just a few years ago, when defeat was regularly snatched from the jaws of victory, it was a heartening sight, and one which bodes well for the future of the club. It is also pleasing to note that, whatever changes in The Village, one thing will always remain: dodgy umpiring.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="">Man of the Match: Mark, Mate of Marcus, for his match-winning 50 on debut, made even more remarkable by his claim not to have batted for two years previously. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="">Honourable mentions go to Uncle Ben Rhys Evans, David Ireland and Alex Hanson.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
