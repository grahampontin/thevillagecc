<div class=report_title>Match Report</div>
<div><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Perhaps it was the cloudy June sky. Perhaps it was the humidity in the nearly-Hertfordshire air. Or perhaps it was the fact that the Village had come to play a game of cricket on a muddy football pitch. Whatever the reason, as they looked out from their vantage point on the by-line beyond the goalposts to the ground and realised that the yellow specks just visible above the long grass were, in fact, boundary markers, something told Village seers that today would be a tough day for batsmen. They were, at least, half right.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">In Suburbia</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">An atmosphere of organised relaxation pervaded the sub-urban park as a loose crowd of fortysomething divorcees enjoyed leisure time with their &lsquo;partners&rsquo; and collective children at the Albert Road Recreation Ground Caf&eacute;. But while their demeanour hinted that many of the locals had fallen out of their IKEA futons and on to the caf&eacute;&rsquo;s concrete terrace, for the Village, the journey to the Albert Wreck had been long. Not merely the journey up from London to the Northern hill resort of Mudwell; hours of heated argument, weeks of administrative wrangling and months of painstaking research by New Village Home Ground (NVHG) activists had culminated in this moment: the Village&rsquo;s first ever game on the Albert Retch. </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The two captains crossed the touchline and hacked their way through the long grass to the middle for the toss, carefully skirting the swamp in the centre circle and leaping those parts of the penalty area that a recent rugby boot-stamping competition had turned into puddles of viscous mud. Both men knew they were competing for the right to say a single word: insert. But it was a toss that only one man could win. And that man&rsquo;s name was Kiwi Paul Big Nuts Edith &ldquo;KP&ldquo; Bowman. The Village would field.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Left To My Own Devices</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Mav, arriving at the ground precisely on the stroke of 2, took to the field a trifle hung over after a night of &ndash; something or other &ndash; but in good time to see Coach&rsquo;s openers wade to the crease. At number one, Ian was an accomplished-looking Australian, while Jon Schnadhorst was a comfy-looking East Londoner as well as Coach&rsquo;s spiritual and actual leader. Village skipper KP elected to open the bowling with legendary Italian/Geordie playboy Damone di Wake, fresh from his native Porto Cervo, where he had been guest of honour at the nuptial orgy of two of England&rsquo;s wealthiest asbo-holders.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">But if &ldquo;Mmm Damone&rdquo; was perspiring Lambrini, he hid it well, bowling tidily down the hill to keep Coach&rsquo;s scoring slow. At the other end, the skipper himself took charge, conceding almost nothing. When a second over from the flagging Wake saw the batsmen begin to open up, the Italian was withdrawn from the attack, to be replaced by Mav. With KP keeping things tight bowling down the hill, the pair looked in good nick, and were able to keep the run rate to a crawl. At the same time, bowling up-hill on to a pitch with no bounce, Mav looked unlikely to take any wickets. Indeed, several overs in, the run rate worm was still flat-lining but it seemed none of the opening trio of bowlers would be rewarded for his toil with the scalp of a Coach batsman. </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">It was time for a decision. Drawing on the deep reserves of cricketing knowledge and resourcefulness that form part of every New Zealand child&rsquo;s basic education, KP made his second change. Mav was rested for an over, then brought on at the other end to bowl down the hill, with someone else replacing him up the slope. The improvement was immediate, the ball rearing up significantly for anything short of a Yorker. Rejuvenated, Mav bent his back and beat the bat a few times before finally getting his edge &ndash; a big snick, which sent the ball ballooning up and behind towards the cordon &ndash; only to sail between second slip and gulley. &ldquo;A moral wicket&rdquo; di Wake generously observed in his broken English. But unfortunately, moral wickets don&rsquo;t go down in the book.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">It&rsquo;s A Sin</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Despite the lack of breakthrough, things were looking good and the team was buoyant, generating plenty of hilarious chat, all of which your author has forgotten, right across the small Albert Wrench outfield,. No wickets had fallen, but coach had still scored diddly squat and there was genuine cause for optimism. Having expended his own six overs for just 17 runs, the skipper threw the ball to relative newcomer and former serial first-ball victim &ldquo;Golden&rdquo; Danny Lamond with mentally sub-normal Shoe Bombing terrorist Richard &ldquo;Saul&rdquo; Reid (probably?) at the other end. Saul&rsquo;s deliveries (tofu and ginger vol au vents, with a hint of lime) went at 11 an over but when the Schnadmeister tried to tuck into one of Lamond&rsquo;s, he had picked the wrong man, clean bowled for 28. Meanwhile, undaunted by his vintage &ndash; i.e. very expensive &ndash; bowling, Shoe exacted his revenge from fine leg, his superb run-out of Aussie Ian (42) a just reward for another impressive day in the field from the misguided fundamentalist. All in all, things were still looking Ok at the Albert Reek: Coach were two down; their score had crept significantly higher to a hundred and something but how far down did they bat?&nbsp;Village were about to find out, as Gregory, Coach batter number four, strode to the crease.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Two Divided By Zero</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">In short, Coach&rsquo;s batting line-up proved both tenacious and talented. Nos three and four, decked out in their side&rsquo;s distinctive maroon caps, eerily resembled the openers &ndash; except that they seemed able to hit the ball harder. The home side were suddenly struggling and needed inspiration. It was time for The Example.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Needless to say, the immaculate former Indian international* stepped up to the plate and delivered a devastating spell that left Dave W&rsquo;s stumps in disarray and Gregory stumped, out by a mile. However, this was not before the former had racked up a quickfire 65 runs. Some came off E.G. himself whose six overs went for 34, and some off new bowler Craig Woodlouse, introduced from the other end. The Louse started well. Although there was little sign of the extra pace the troubled slow-medium pacer had promised to work on during a sabbatical half-year playing county cricket in nearby Yorkshire, it was apparent that he had added two distinctive feathers to his bowling cap: the ability to find a testing line and a surprising level of pumpedness that at times almost threatened to boil over into outright aggression, something rarely seen in hitherto gentle Village games. </span></div>

<div><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The Northern coiffeur&rsquo;s ire might have spurred a more competitive outfit into action. But not the Village. Not at the Albert Rusk. From here on in, the myrtle-caps&rsquo; ground fielding started to deteriorate, their scattered XI more and more closely resembling a bunch of arthritic lard-arses &ndash; which is ironic, because that is what they in fact are. Hard-hit fours whistled by fielders who seemed not to have the first idea how to stop them, if they noticed them at all. Catching chances came &ndash; and went. Bomb put down a flat six that was aimed at his head while Mav jogged in to claim a skier near the boundary, only to watch the ball somehow travel straight through his fingers. In all, seven Villagers dropped catches, including Luca and five others, whose names history, thankfully, does not recall&hellip;</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">By the time &ldquo;Mmm Damone&rdquo; had bowled the final ball of the innings, ending a disastrous last over that went for 74 and lasted over an hour, the Coach had put together a whopping 230 odd. Andy had relieved the pain momentarily by taking a wicket &ndash; a firmly struck straight drive caught beautifully by William Hague sound-a-like Ed Thomas at mid-on &ndash; but as far as wickets went, that was it. </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Damone&rsquo;s woeful closing over was attributed by some onlookers to a bizarre incident, in which, having fielded and returned the ball, the Geordie Eyeteye triumphantly but unexpectedly leapt into one of the Albert Wreath&rsquo;s many quagmires and literally covered himself from head to toe in slimy brown mud, playing out the rest of the game looking like a strange beast in whites &ndash; half-man, half-excrement. A spokesman for Di Wake&rsquo;s later told journalists that he had mistaken the mud pond for an enormous bowl of truffles.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Domino Dancing</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">After a short pause for reflection, the Village went in to bat desperate and determined to wipe the insult of the Coach&rsquo;s innings from the slate. Naturally, their optimism was entirely misplaced and the less that is said about their batting performance, the better. Lithe Fife wicketkeeper Graham McPontin went in swinging. The IT consultant and fluent binary-speaker opened up with two consecutive fours but &nbsp;was then out bowled for 8 or &ldquo;1-0-0-0&rdquo; as he would say. </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Former Labour Party chairman Ed Thomas put together a promising string of characteristically conservative (small c) dot balls and singles before losing his s---, courtesy of Schnadhorst. Meanwhile, Thomas&rsquo; political opposite number, Tory activist Alan Bomb clung on, discovering, after getting his eye in, that on a stupidly short boundary against an attack consisting of slow and very slow pies, hitting sixes isn&rsquo;t actually that tough. Alas, his 51 was to be the only creditable performance. Burly nu-grunge bassist Andrew Richardson went in at four with the weight of the team&rsquo;s expectation adding to the considerable burden already on his broad shoulders. Richardson&rsquo;s discovery was that while some balls definitely can be slogged for six by a batsman with his eye in, others cannot: he quickly came unstuck, bowled for one.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The skipper&rsquo;s arrival at the crease might have brought some gritty antipodean batting to the Albert Wretch. But it didn&rsquo;t. Faced with more looping deliveries, KP&rsquo;s eyes lit up and he was unable to stop himself from trying to cash in, statim. A huge six was followed by a huge airshot and &nbsp;the captain&rsquo;s timbers were splayed. In came The Example, who stuck around with Bomb to hit some typically stylish runs before being caught at point. It was Mav&rsquo;s turn next, but he didn&rsquo;t last long, a brief spell of careful build-up play quickly forgotten as he gently spooned a slow-but-bouncy pie (rabbit and coriander) to silly mid-off. Mmm Damone&rsquo;s opportunity to redeem himself with the bat arrived, but the dual-tone batsman could only watch as another stumps-bound delivery from Ian hit its mark. The Shoe Bomb&rsquo;s appearance at the wicket in an eyecatching pair of yellow light-enhancing spectacles distracted the fielding side long enough for him to get off the mark with a single. It would be his last contribution to the match, however, castled for one. The partnership of Louse and Lamond was the Village&rsquo;s last chance to cling on. It didn&rsquo;t last long, Lamond becoming the seventh Village batsman to be bowled, and the fifth to lose his stumps at the Albert Rank without getting above single figures. It would be fair to say that everyone batted woefully, save Bomb, who grafted his way to fifty, and Eklavya, who hit 23. </span></div>

<div><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Se a Vida &eacute; (That's the Way Life Is)</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The best thing about the day&rsquo;s sport was that a squalid defeat meant the Village could get stuck into an activity in which they are undisputed champions: the mulling over of a needless defeat &ndash; at length &ndash; over alcohol. Looking back, there was little to debate about the day&rsquo;s most irritating fact &ndash; that after a spell of typically woeful fielding, the Village batting line-up had struggled against some of the most anodyne bowling it&rsquo;s possible to face. Neither was the poor quality of the ground any excuse. It was simple. The canny Coachmen aimed at the Villagers&rsquo; stumps and the Villagers didn&rsquo;t deign to defend them. This style of play simply could not go on.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Or could it?</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Man of the Match is between Bomb for his 51 and EK who bowled 6 overs for 34 runs and took 2 wickets, then made 23 runs with the bat: Bomb takes the prize for being the only Villager to score over 25 runs.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Village idiot is between all the fielders who dropped straightforward catches and Damon Wake for his pig-in-s**t impression and final over implosion, the wooden spoon probably going to Damon.</span></div>
