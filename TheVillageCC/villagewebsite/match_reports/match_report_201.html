<div>When one thinks of cricket, certain locations automatically spring to mind. Croydon is rarely one of them. However it was to Croydon that we were bound on an early summer&rsquo;s day, to play against the Old Whitgiftians on their own ground. In the event, the drive down from civilisation was not unpleasant. Your correspondent passed unexpected fields and woods on his way to the famously grim South London conurbation. He passed them pretty fast, because (his TomTom having failed to recognise any destinations south of river, necessitating tortuous one-handed A-Z-guided driving) he was late. Arrival at the ground yielded some pleasant surprises: the game had not begun; the ground looked good; the bar and clubhouse looked excellent; everyone had turned up. We (presumably) lost the toss and Whits decided to bat. It might be clutching at straws to claim that your correspondent&rsquo;s wearying journey and quick change were to blame for the Village&rsquo;s first major error of the day.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The first few overs saw Bun unleash his usual brisk and aggressive medium pace with Boa doing something similar at the other end, but managing to get less angry about it. The Whits&rsquo; opening bats looked classy &ndash; in particular the slender Ayyub, whose initial prods hinted at some elegance. But he had clearly not yet got set when he flicked a chance towards Ireland at midwicket. The ball looped through the air towards a spot a few yards in front of the fielder who, for reasons of his own, elected to block it with his foot as if the whole concept of dismissed caught had simply not occurred to him. It was a chance The Village would rue. In fact, in terms of subsequent runs made, it may be The Village&rsquo;s most rued chance ever. Ayyub is, it turns out, an extremely good batsman and once his eye was in, the runs fairly flowed from his bat, despatching the ball to all parts of the ground with well timed strokes.The scorecard does not recount the order of wickets, but the first (?) fell to Ireland&rsquo;s opening ball of the day, a nice enough delivery that swung away just enough from the top of Higgins&rsquo;s off stump and was nicely caught by Chris Magnifique behind the stumps, gone for 19. At the other end, Village newcomer and friend of Boa, Kennedy bowled well for no wicket, improving with each over. Meanwhile, Ireland&rsquo;s metabolic state was sub-optimal and a two-over spell without a drinks break was asking a lot. A second over devoid of line and length saw him carted around, notably over the short square boundary for six by Ayyub, who showed he was as happy on the hook as on the drive.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>With the Old Whits&rsquo; score starting to tick over worryingly fast, the next of the Village bowlers was brought on: the bearded Bird. This was (was it?) a fine debut for another friend and countryman of the Constrictor. A long and assured spell of quick and accurate bowling accounted for Arief and Amin, LBW and bowled for 25 and 33. Ayyub was still accumulating, however, and compiled a richly-deserved hundred before smashing a huge on-drive off Gupte high over Boa on the boundary. Boa planted himself under the ball, stood stock still and held a testing chance with consummate antipodean confidence. By now, the Old Whits had put [insert number here] on the board, which felt perhaps a touch under par &ndash; a spirited slog in the final few overs would give the Village a daunting total. But while the square leg boundary was admittedly fairly short (and downhill) acres of long grass lay between the pitch and the boundary rope on all the other sides and some accurate bowling to the middle order by Harty helped keep the run rate down in the closing stages. It also accounted for Mir, who was well caught by Troja, possibly at mid off or cover, or maybe mid-wicket. It was a fitting reward for the Australian right-wing political aide, who earlier in the afternoon had come within centimetres of taking a stunning leaping-salmon style catch off a flat Ayyub off (or possibly on) drive that was travelling at Mach 3.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The afternoon was drifting on with no clear sign of a victory for either side, when the day&rsquo;s most dramatic events struck. A ball from [insert bowler&rsquo;s name] was lashed square by [insert batsman&rsquo;s name] and Morgans set off along the boundary from deep mid on to intercept it. It was a flat race between Welshman and ball and a tight one at that. With both participants yards from the point of impact with the rope, Morgs made to plant a boot and block the ball. Alas, the ball outpaced him, rolling under his foot as he brought it down so that his not inconsiderable weight went through an ankle whose angle of impact with the ground was beyond 45 degrees. I didn&rsquo;t hear the crack, but it was clear a nasty injury had occurred and within a minute, Morgs&rsquo; ankle was the size of a small melon.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In retrospect, calling an ambulance to take the injured Morgs to hospital seems an exaggerated gesture, but he wasn&rsquo;t taking any risks with broken bones and nor, as he said himself, did any other options for getting home present themselves. Certainly the scenes, captured on camera, of the brave Taff being auto-lifted in his trolley into the back of the emergency vehicle, were more than faintly absurd. The ankle turned out to be sprained, a word that for my money doesn&rsquo;t cover the intense pain and often permanent ligament damage sustained in this kind of injury.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>With the Morgs hearse departed, Ayyub, in so many ways the hero of this piece, generously offered himself as a replacement fielder. Ireland returned to the attack, much improved after a couple of glasses of water, and delivered a spell that was at least more consistent than his first, and he claimed the wicket of the tall blond Mann with a ball that started on leg and hit middle.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>With our allotted overs bowled, it was time for tea. Or it would have been, had there been any. A message came out that tea had accidentally been eaten by a team playing on a nearby pitch. Old Whits responded brilliantly to the situation by ordering a vast amount of takeaway pizza, chicken wings and similar from a local establishment and so began one of the most calorific teas number three batsman Steve Harty has ever had the pleasure of declining. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t bat after that&rdquo; his surprising excuse. Your loyal correspondent tucked in all the more.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We made an acceptable dent in the pizzas, then spent a good while letting them settle and thinking about what we&rsquo;d just done. It was time to resume hostilities. Hindle opened, taking the sting out of their best bowlers and notching up a very well made 27 before falling unluckily to Arief. This brought the ascetic Harty to the crease and the Australian oilman (probably) set about his task diligently at first, knocking the ball around for ones and twos. When his partner Chris Donald was cut off prematurely, caught and bowled by Kashief for 1, it was time for Troja and an All-Australian Village partnership. The Whits threw what they had at the pair but they didn&rsquo;t seem to have that much and by the time the spinners were on, Harty&rsquo;s eye was in and the ball was regularly flying to, and sometimes over the boundary.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>With a handful of overs to go, the Village&rsquo; target was tantalisingly within reach and Old Whits must have known it was time to bring on a seasoned death bowler. Which is why everyone was surprised to see the ball thrown to a child. Perhaps the innocent face looping flight would have bamboozled a less determined bat. Harty was both brutal and nerveless. A string of boundaries, including successive sixes, ensued and the match was won with (hold on while I do the maths) about three overs to spare.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A strong man of the match contender must be &ldquo;Feather&rdquo; Boa for a solid spell of 5-an-over and a crucial catch on the boundary. However the award goes to Harty for his savage but effective treatment of tailenders of both the bowling and batting variety.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Village idiot could go to Morgs for his tragi-comical departure, but in the event has to be Ireland&rsquo;s for a spectacular spell of dreaming in the field that could easily have cost us the game.</div>
