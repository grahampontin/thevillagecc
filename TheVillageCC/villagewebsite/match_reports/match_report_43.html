<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">The Village CC is known throughout the land (well, throughout Hackney and parts of North and <st1:place w:st="on">Central London</st1:place>) for many things. Pedantry? Oh yes indeed. Ineptitude? Why, most certainly. Resilience? Indubitably. For a fine example of the latter, one need only look back a few weeks, to the events of Saturday June 30.<o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">The day dawned, like so many Saturdays before it in this dank and largely cricket-less summer, wet and wild. An early morning text from Captain Pontin confirmed that the league match against the Coach and Horses was off. Lesser teams would have sunk into a slough of despond or melodramatically thrown their collective arms to the heavens, crying out as one to a seemingly uncaring god, &ldquo;O Lord, why hast thou forsaken us?&rdquo; Lesser teams, that is, but not the men and women of The Village. These lucky few did not crumble, they did not lay down and die. They took a moment to sagely consider their disappointment and then, as one, remembered the old adage, central to the club&rsquo;s very nature: &ldquo;When the going gets tough, the tough go quizzing.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">That night, Hackney&rsquo;s own Pembury Tavern was packed to the rafters with Villagers, all keen to pit their wits against the wily conundrums posed by Page in the inaugural Know Your Village quiz. In a process which made the FA Cup 3<sup>rd</sup> Round draw seem swift and exciting by comparison, teams were selected at random, with old Village lags sprinkled liberally alongside fresh-faced newcomers, glory-hunting Johnny Come Latelys and the finest WAGs this side of Team <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>. <o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">It was fascinating to note the differing warm-up routines of each participant: Captain Pontin, for example, had sharpened himself up by engaging in a little light role-play involving sheep, while Phil Stott and Del Jones had enjoyed more than a few libations, to the extent that Miss Jones later told your humble correspondent that she was &lsquo;mortal&rsquo; before the contest even began. Perhaps the strangest mode of preparation belonged to John Lucarotti, who, less than 48 hours earlier, had decided to dice with certain death outside a trendy <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">London</st1:city></st1:place> nitespot targeted for destruction by terrorists. <o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">With much further ado, largely about nothing, the contest finally got underway. It quickly became clear that the questions had an unmistakeable flavour to them: Essence of Page. Some found it tough to keep up, preferring instead to take solace in drink to blot out the embarrassment and shame. The rest struggled manfully on, plumbing the very depths of their knowledge to retrieve gems such as the name of the head of the parish council in inexplicably popular shitcom &lsquo;The Vicar of Dibley&rsquo; and the correct terminology for an animal that is part lion, part eagle.<o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Eventually, only one round remained, one that would test Villagers knowledge not only of themselves but also of the (in)glorious history of the very club that defined them. By this point, the battle for the crown of Quiz Champions had been whittled down to a two-horse race. Holding a slender advantage was a team consisting of Ed Thomas, AJ Warner, KP Bowman and Molly, paramour of Village swing king Craig &lsquo;Emma&rsquo; Woodhouse. Close behind were the pre-match favourites, a squad containing no less than 3 men who played in the Village&rsquo;s first-ever fixture: Andrew Edward McClarence Richardson-Richardson, the afore-mentioned lucky young scamp John Lucarotti and Nigel &lsquo;Neil&rsquo; Johnson. Alongside these pillars of testosterone, and providing some much-needed feminine guile, were Julia &lsquo;Mrs Nige&rsquo; Worboys and Del Jones, no more sober than when she arrived. The stage was set for a titanic last round and so it would prove to be.<o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">As the final set of questions were read out, a deathly hush enveloped the arena. Foreheads were scratched, memory banks searched and pen lids chewed until, eventually, it was all over. The final marks were added up, the scores read out in ascending order until the result was clear for all to see. Like true sprinters, the team led by Richardson-Richardson had come off the shoulder of the leader on the final bend and breasted the tape first. They were thus free to drink from the keg of glory, and did so with abandon. But, though there were winners, it would be wrong to say that, on this night of courage and strength in adversity, there were any losers. The rain may take the cricket, but it would take a torrent of biblical proportions to dampen the spirit of The Village.<o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>
