<strong>METHOD</strong></p>
<p><br />
1.&nbsp; Spend the entire week prior to the game attempting to source an opposition online, separating the viable options from the idiots. Discard the (many) excess time wasters.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Having sourced an opposition, wait whilst they arrive. Simmer gently as your own captain is also late to the game.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Toss the coin, call incorrectly. Prepare the fielders by throwing some matured nuts at them in the outfield.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Set your Thomo to hot and throw in one ripe cherry. Wait one delivery until he has removed the opening batsmen from the crease. Gather together your players in the middle and stir, add a pinch of mild chat.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Fire up your Toby at the other end and wait for him to find a good length.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Wearing oven mitts, attempt to take a hot edge behind off your brother&rsquo;s bowling. Gently place the cherry on the ground. Lambast quietly.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Returning to your Thomo, bring him to the boil until he has taken 4 wickets, folding in a splendid running diving catch by Ek at mid-off. Set the Thomo aside. Praise faintly.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Bring Eddie on at one end and wait for him to rise. Combine with one skipper until they have taken one wicket each. Rest both.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; Mix in some Buffalo into your chat cauldron and heat until he starts popping loudly. </p>
<p>10. Finally, spoon in some Ek and clean up the tail.</p>
<p>11. Leave the field and allow your players to settle.</p>
<p>12. Sprinkle light rain on to the pitch to add some spice.</p>
<p>13. Send JdM and Cressey into the mixer. Add one that does not get up and an LBW shout. Trigger.</p>
<p>14. Unwrap the Parp and insert for four balls before removing the top of off.</p>
<p>15. Grind some Oliver Morgans into a fine paste. Slather across the innings for a sumptuous 50. Add in some red ink.</p>
<p>16. Mix together some solid Troj and finish with some fine Tobes runs.</p>
<p>17. Add a large dash of appreciation to the opposition for stepping up in the first place and playing on through the rain.</p>
<p>18. Move your team from the ground to Eddie&rsquo;s places. Mix in the craft beers, sausage and gerbils.</p>
<p>19. Place Eddie&rsquo;s on a rack to cool and move to random local boozer. Garnish with car crash at a junction, blue flashing lights, and a bizarre conversation where Eddie is not mistaken for Jesus but the local bus controller.</p>
<p>20. Consume.<br />

<strong>EDDIE&rsquo;S SPICY SAUSAGE RECIPE</strong><br />
<br />
This is enough for about 4 hungry villagers<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>200g mixed bean packet (ie kidney, pinto, butter beans)</li>
    <li>8 decent quality sausages (spicy ones best)</li>
    <li>6-8&quot; (fnarr, fnarr) of chorizo (spicy ones best)</li>
    <li>1 large onion</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>1 tin chopped tomato</li>
    <li>500g decent quality beef stock</li>
    <li>paprika</li>
    <li>chili powder</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Overnight soak the 500g packet of mixed beans, then boil in water for about 30 mins and drain<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Meanwhile, grill the sausages for 20 mins and get rid of the fat - wait to cool and cut each one in quarters<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Chop the onions and garlic and fry in large casserole dish until brown, then add the quartered sausages. Cut the chorizo into 5mm slices and add. Then put in the tinned tomatoes, beef stock and the beans. Then add a tablespoon of paprika, and a teaspoon of chili powder. Give it a good stir and wait there until the whole lot comes to the boil, stirring regularly. Once its boiling, turn right down to a simmer with a lid on, checking and stirring every 10 mins or so. Give it about 1 1/2 hours and hey presto :-)</p>
