<div class=report_title>Match Report</div>
<div>T.S. Eliot got it wrong. If you're a cricket captain then August, not April, is the cruellest month. Cricketers go on holiday, lose form, grow disillusioned, start playing football and generally don't give a toss. Not the time for a double header against arguably the strongest team in the league. Massive kudos to KP for managing to get teams out, and not bad ones at that. Despite numerous exhortations from various players for a winner-takes-all two day Test, this was to be the first of two games. Winning both would give Island a chance of winning the league.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>
<div>It was, to put it bluntly, exactly the same as the Ravens game at the Wreck. As in that game, it was swinging like a brass band on the corner of East and 65th street, and as in that game Bomb opened up and took the first four wickets. At the other end KP was struggling, clearly still hindered by an ankle injury that has, to put it politely, well and truly buggered his season. His replacement, ringer no. 1 Amit, charged in and made life very, very uncomfortable for the batsmen with his searing pace, but in best Lyneham tradition only managed a lucky wicket. Given that the batsman fell to a diving catch from Bomb, we're probably talking one of the luckiest wickets of the year. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Now would be a good time to mention ringer no. 2 Arif, who looked quite good but didn't do much with bat or ball - however, he did provide some wonderful entertainment for the batting team by using every single swear word this correspondent thinks he's ever ever heard while on the phone to an unscrupulous travel agent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Anyway, from thereon it all went a bit pear shaped. As is often the case in league games we didn't have enough bowling depth, and Island's lower order smashed a load of runs. 190 was a pretty good total on a wicket that was a bit up and down at one end, and it already looked way out of reach by the time heavy rain arrived over lunch and gave it even more spice - again, exactly the same as the Ravens game.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Not much else to report. Given how much the rain had screwed up the pitch, the quality of Island's attack, and the fact that we were a somewhat rag tag bunch, 140 wasn't a bad effort. Amit continued his impressive debut by looking absolutely awesome with the bat, until Chris MON sent him on his way LBW despite an inside edge that reverberated around Muswell Hill. No one managed to get any serious runs. The pitch was to blame for many of the dismissals, though Bomb deserves special mention for his conversation with KP out in the middle. Telling the captain to relax and not worry about the spinner, he promptly lost his middle stump to an atrocious hoick that wouldn't have looked out of place on the front cover of Farming Weekly. His conversion from opening bat and occasional bowler to opening bowler and occasional batsman continues.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>That's really it - it was all a bit flat, probably because we were a slightly cobbled together side and it was all a bit meaningless as we weren't going to win the league, along with the fact that conditions chutneyed us. Meh. Fortunately the season picked up again.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>MoM - in an unprecedented move I'm giving it to myself, partly because no one else really got any runs or wickets and partly because it was my first ever catch for the team.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Village Idiot - The departing Chris MON, who managed to combine having his bowling collared with triggering the one batsman who might have given us a chance - poor MON will now have to wait till next season to make amends.</div>

The wreck. Up and down, side to side, you get the idea.
