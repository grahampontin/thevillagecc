<conditions><p>&nbsp;Warm. Overcast. Rural.</p> </conditions><p>&nbsp;An inspection of the tube map will tell you that it is in Zone 4, but Villagers disembarking from the highly irregular weekend service to Mill Hill East will attest that this is one of the most rural places we play cricket outside of Wiltshire tour. There&rsquo;s a steep hill. There&rsquo;s a narrow road. There&rsquo;s a field of cows. There&rsquo;s a tattered Union flag dangling limply from the post next to the club house. There&rsquo;s European-style shower facilities.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>And there&rsquo;s St Anne&rsquo;s All Stars: random collection of the letters A, S, and apostrophes; long-term friends of the Village; occasional borrowers of talent. During the preceding week a plan for our own Kiwi Paul to lead SAAS fell apart, so it fell to Kiwi Ben to lead the oppo out instead. So disappointed were we at this turn of events that only 9 Villagers pitched up to play, including two debutantes in Sean Dean and James Hillier.</div>
<div>Miami Vice Welsh Love Dragon lost the toss in the absence of our club captain and SAAS elected to bat first. England A Wicketkeeper Lookalike opened the bowling and would go on to deliver two classic spells of VCC pace bowling that completely defeated the batsmen without actually defeating any of them. Instead it was Prash at the other end that took the first scalp which he enjoyed only by turning on his heels and calmly strolling back to his mark while being barracked by his skipper for the lack of celebrating with the team.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hillier and Discharge came on as first changes and would finish with two wickets apiece, which included a (now increasingly rare) spell of half-decent team chat based around an (even more rare) Vicious delivery from C-pitch which inspired a selection of rock and pop references: &ldquo;Pitch Zee&rdquo; probably being the pick. The hilarity was cut short, however, when the ball seemed dissatisfied with having just clonked the top of middle stump, since it carried on into JDM&rsquo;s face and clonked him in the middle of his honk.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This led to JDM coming out from behind the stumps (much to the surprise of his wife) and hurriedly deploying some ice to maintain the face of Next&rsquo;s forthcoming Autumn Winter campaign. He was clearly rattled and perhaps concerned at the possibility of losing the Best De Mellow Of The Day award despite his brother not playing, so promptly came on to bowl and tore through the tail ending with unprecedented and perhaps staggering figures of 6-2-22-4. However the wicket we all wanted survived stranded; not out, but out of partners. St Anne&rsquo;s had posted 137 from 34 of the 35 overs on offer. We shall not mention the skipper&rsquo;s figures of 1-0-13-0.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>St Anne&rsquo;s provided a top, top spread, featuring an excellent selection of sausage rolls with diddy beers to wash them down with. At least one villager was rumbled eating fruit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Yoda and JDM opened up the batting and got the run chase off to a very decent start before JDM perished in unfortunate style, with a fuller Ben delivery appearing to be heading past leg stump as it cannoned off the batman&rsquo;s ankles and on to the timbers. Captain Morgans came in and was immediately wrapped on the pads by a good Hampton inswinger that did just too much.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Village began to work towards their target at some pace, losing Yoda to another unfortunate drag-on, with Sean &lsquo;Deano&rsquo; Dean taking over. Whilst the newbie&rsquo;s batting was resolute and noteworthy, it will not be noted further here, for instead it was his beautiful weapon that caught the eye of all spectators. Coloured a deep, tanned brown, thinnish and very well maintained, it was quite majestic to behold. And ancient. Antique in fact. Apparently it is a family heirloom &ndash; probably originally owned by Deano&rsquo;s grandfather or even great-grandfather &ndash; it looked as if it might spontaneously evaporate back down the wormhole that must have first delivered it to the crease, but it played remarkably well for such an old piece.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Sadly Sean And His Chocolate Bat&rsquo;s excellent debut ended on 11 when &ndash; &nbsp;perhaps dazzled by the sight of such exotic wood dangling around at the other end &ndash; Morgans chipped the ball towards short cover, who could only get part of hand to the ball instead of taking what would have been a sharp catch. Seeing this misfield our skipper called for a ditzy run before attempting to send his partner back as he saw Ben &lsquo;Could Not Keep Him Out Of&nbsp;The Game&rsquo; Hampton scooping up the ball on the run in from mid-off, then launching an underarm straight into middle stump which gave Sean no chance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>One freshly minted Villager was replaced by another, as Hillier came in and wasted no time in constructing a pleasingly aggressive innings in quick time. With the big hitting came a couple of opportunities for St Anne&rsquo;s to catch him out, but ultimately it would prove to be a match-winning knock plus red ink as, with the scores level, JH smeared the ball through midwicket for a maximum, returning to the pavilion on 42 not out having collected six boundaries along the way.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In the later stages of our innings Ollie had perished lbw Hampton while attempting that bloody reverse sweep. Morgans was unusually displeased with the umpire&rsquo;s decision, claiming that the ball had in fact struck him on the paw not the pad. Ollie was replaced by Oliver &lsquo;Two Footlong&rsquo; Ball who recognised the match situation and hence obliterated his first three balls to the boundary, except that on the third occasion a short mid-on was directly in the line of fire. The fielder sensibly elected to catch the ball else he would not likely have survived such a shot straight through his midriff.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Several contenders for our Man Of The Match including the skipper&rsquo;s solid 35 and JDM&rsquo;s fourfer. However, James will have to settle for just the Best De Mellow award as it was the other James who just nosed it (HUR! HUR!!) on this occasion with an excellent all-round debut effort, having removed St Anne&rsquo;s set number three bat with a lovely outswinger that took the edge well taken by Morgans at slip, fielding superbly saving at least a dozen runs sweeping on the boundary, and then finally hitting the winning runs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>VCC and SAAS decamped to a local pub where Ball somehow survived on only one meal and C-pitch chowed down a beetroot risotto which looked very much like it had recently plopped out the back end of a malnutritioned My Little Pony.</div>
