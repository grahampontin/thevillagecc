<div class=report_title>Match Report</div>
<div><font size="2">&quot;Bent double, like old beggars under sacks, &amp;#8232;</font> <br />
<font size="2">Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge&hellip;&quot;</font> </div>
<div></div>
<div><font size="2">Given the ceaseless fall of rain over Highgate all morning, that we played cricket at all was largely thanks to the groundsman's cheerful disregard for the well-being of his pitch.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font></div>
<div><font size="2">KP: (Returning from the middle and getting out of his canoe)&nbsp; &quot;So do you reckon it's okay to play?&quot;</font> </div>
<div><font size="2">Groundsman: (Counting match fee and cackling maniacally) &quot;Oh yes, it'll be fine, don't worry about it.&quot;</font> </div>
<div><font size="2"></font></div>
<div><font size="2">Eventually the downpour abated enough for the Rain Men's opening bowler (one A.J.White, late of this parish) to start up from the Shallow End without getting too much water in his roast pepper quiche. </font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font></div>
<div><font size="2">Village opened with the classic Preparation-Fudge one-two, presumably on the basis that Sri Lanka won the 1996 World Cup with a fat bloke and a bald bloke opening, but given that the light was poor and the ground like a paddy field, they struggled to hit it off the square. Or even just hit it, in Prep's case.</font></div>
<div><font size="2">Parp was soon trapped in front, bringing the avenging blade of A.A.Page to the crease. After striking a couple of lusty blows, the loquacious geologist tried to heave Bomb into the stands once too often, and fell to a startlingly sharp caught and bowled.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font></div>
<div><font size="2">The Rain Men, many of whom still labour under the mistaken belief that Bomb is a serious sportsman, whooped and high-fived in delight; seasoned White-watchers were open-mouthed with disbelief. So profound was the impact of the catch on non-striker Fudge's whole understanding of the universe that he nearly had to Retire Bewildered.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font></div>
<div><font size="2">But the Bald Amigo soon regained his composure and quietly milked Bomb while a weaselly-bearded man exploited favourable conditions at the Waterslide End to run through the middle order and finish with a four-fer.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font></div>
<div><font size="2">Thanks to a doughty 18* from Plimmer and third-top-score of 17 from stalwart F.Extras, Village dragged themselves to an almost-respectable 98 all out.</font></div>
<div><font size="2">It was never enough, though, even on a soaking wet pitch, and when the sun came out and dried the outfield between innings the writing was on the wall for the Village, and the writing was poorly spelt.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font></div>
<div><font size="2">The Rain Men innings began promisingly enough for Village, with Parp flinging himself low and left to take a catch with an enthusiasm he usually reserves for the cheeseboard.</font></div>
<br />
<div><font size="2">His mental visualisation training over the winter had clearly paid off - once he imagined it was a cheese roll being struck at him, there was only one outcome.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font></div>
<div><font size="2">Danny the Champion of the World Lamond bowled intensely miserly stuff from the other end and chipped in with two wickets, but with the ball moving more freely over the drying outfield, the Rain Men closed in on their target.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font></div>
<div><font size="2">Bomb poked and prodded and grumbled his way to spirit-crushing 21* in about an hour and a half before some other bloke came in and smashed a breezy 25 in about 10 balls - including a huge six into someone's garden - to see the Rain Men home.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font></div>
<div><font size="2">Man of the Match - Danny tCotW Lamond, for a fine spell. Mention for Parp's really very good diving catch at cover.</font></div>
