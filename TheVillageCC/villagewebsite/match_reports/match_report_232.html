<conditions><p>&nbsp;14 degrees and overcast</p> </conditions><p>&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;">It was a grey cold day in May, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Play was due to commence, however, the hallowed turf of Parliament Hill was cordoned off by a Met Police exercise. The Met were showing young children a German Sheppard launching an attack on an unsuspecting individual with what appeared to be some kind of a cast on their arm. The point of this exercise wasn&rsquo;t immediately obvious; perhaps it was to show the perils of wearing some kind of a cast? One or two Villagers were keeping their distance from the dog or the handler, or both. Those in attendance to this encounter last year will recall the Met were also present admonishing one of our longest serving members for watering the plants without the proper permission. Indeed that sort behaviour has been brought up again this year by the local council.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The opposition were fielding something of a second string line up to the 2012 vintage, evidently the core of the pace attack had returned to the sub continent following the completion of their studies. The Village bowled first on a damp track, with plenty of grass on the wicket, &lsquo;just the way I like it&rsquo; quipped an unnamed Villager. After an off season with endless hours in the gym, Alan opened the attack with Glen. Variable bounce and line make things a challenge behind the stumps. It was hard work in front of them as well and by the time Matt and James entered the attack the Pecos were 2 or 3 down with not much to show for it. #Boa2014 coming off a shortened run up after exploratory surgery had ruled him out of the first few games, this alteration had no effect on his pace or accuracy though. Wickets continued at regular intervals, with Nick and Ben also rolling their arm over in a tradesman like manner. Pecos limped to 104 for 9 off 35. The state of the wicket coupled with some accruate bowling contributing to the total.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">After a lengthy luncheon adjournment Sam and Ollie were right in the middle of ground ready to open the Village innings. Sam registering the only boundary six of the day over long off, before he was fired, again rueing the lack of DRS availability this season. SB was underdone by the inconsistent bounce, bringing EK into the fray. Ollie rode his luck early on, but, made the only fifty of the day, a change of bat reversing a string of low scores for the big Welshman. The Village losing only two wickets in completing a fairly comprehensive victory. Both teams retiring to a licensed premises nearby, just before the heavens opened, as they had been threatening throughout the day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
