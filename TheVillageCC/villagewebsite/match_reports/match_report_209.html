<conditions><p>Autumnal</p> </conditions><p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt">Previously this season weather conditions have been generally autumnal, Saturday, 23 June 2012, was no different.&nbsp;Predominately the games have been played in autumn, which may help explain these conditions.&nbsp;Experts will tell you that the weather is driven by complex interactions in the atmosphere which are affected by the rotation of the earth and the power of the sun.&nbsp;Some folks will tell you it&rsquo;s all the work of the devil.&nbsp;Others will say it&rsquo;s the aliens in league with the government.&nbsp;We may never know the real answer, what I can tell you is it&rsquo;s just not cricket.</div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt">After winning the toss, the Village elected to have a bat, making the obvious choice under steely grey skies.&nbsp;The Village would start the first half running from left to right, with the wind, which was perfect if you wanted to fly a kite.&nbsp;Due to several absences, either by choice, lack of mental fortitude or physical incapacity, there were three new caps awarded during an emotional ceremony at this days Wimbledon venue.&nbsp;It brought several grown men to tears, it really was heartfelt stuff and probably best described while listening to that timeless track &lsquo;love is in the air&rsquo;.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt">Our hosts for the day had a lively pair of opening bowlers and their batting counterparts were forced into a battle of attrition in the early exchanges.&nbsp;The Village were the first to turn over possession though and following a run out which contained all the confusion and mayhem you might expect at the deaf and blind world cup qualifiers.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; At first drop was a South African, which seemed rather apt considering we were in Little Johannesburg.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, the story of this day doesn&rsquo;t follow a Hollywood film script and VillageBok Jason Lloyd made just two points before he followed fellow debutante Sagar Patel, who&rsquo;d been unfortunately run out without troubling the scorers, back to the dugout.&nbsp;It was gritty stuff out there, with most of the play confined to the very middle of the pitch, right where Southwark and Lambeth&rsquo;s first eleven had kicked off from earlier, into the wind at the opening whistle.&nbsp;Today&rsquo;s captain Steve Harty joined James De Mellow with the scoreboard on 2 for 8 and eked out a twenty run partnership before James was fired for ten.&nbsp;In only his second appearance Kris Bird walked out to the middle and said &lsquo;ahoy there captain&rsquo; in a pirate accent to captain Harty, who seemed ill at ease which such impertinence.&nbsp;However, a marvellous partnership blossomed, containing some of the biggest hits since the Beatles. &nbsp;Harty and Bird plundered over 150 runs, in excess of the benchmark rate of a run a ball.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt">With wickets in hand and six overs remaining, Steve retired on his third hundred of season.&nbsp;A super effort that, made in generally challenging conditions and including a plethora of boundary sixes.&nbsp;Chris Pitchers&rsquo; transformation from wicket taking bowler to wicket keeper batsman has been quite something to behold and today Pitcher delivered yet another curve ball.&nbsp;A quick fire ten runs included a textbook cover drive which quite literally sailed over the rope for a boundary four.&nbsp;Police Academies Glenn Moroney came off the bench, relieving Pitcher and left several opponents in his wake, bisecting the defence with the impunity of an LA cop, circa 1992.&nbsp;Bird was no slouch either, chirping in with few boundary sixes of his own, mostly straight down the middle of the ground.&nbsp;At oranges it was the Village 247, Southwark and Lambeth nil.&nbsp;It had been a bit of a one sided affair thus far, but, the wind was probably with around 200 points Juan would think.&nbsp;Juan also has an IQ of 40 and is what some people call retarded.</div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt">South Pacific Poms dominated the Villages bowling line up today, with big Steve Daly on debut being the only exception.&nbsp;Village Stalwart KP Bowman opened the second half, asking questions right from the start.&nbsp;Questions like &lsquo;are we aliens?&rsquo;&nbsp;These left the batsman scratching their heads.&nbsp;Amid all this confusion and requiring a pinch over a run a ball to take the lead, the opening batsman managed a boundary an over with some ease.&nbsp;There were holes opening up in the Village defensive line and it was just like watching sausages being thrown down a hallway.&nbsp;Change was called for and Ben Hampton was replaced after five and Daly handed his first cap, it was the kind of change we can believe in, not just to make some hummy homeless guy leave you alone.&nbsp;Boa replaced Bowman moments later, only after KP had managed to slip one past the batsmen&rsquo;s defences following a sustained period of possession for the away team.&nbsp;The opposition took their time out with over a ton on the board having slightly edged the Village with a steady opening sequence to the second half.&nbsp;The game was quite evenly matched at this juncture and you feel there was tension in air, where earlier there had been love.</div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt">Daly and Moroney restarted play and both took wickets, but, the batsman continued to punish anything short or wide and the run rate always seemed within reach.&nbsp;Boa and KP returned to the fray, both also collecting wickets.&nbsp;There was somewhat of a mini collapse late on, Pitchers quick thinking effecting a stumping and Daly and Pitcher combining for a run out shortly after.&nbsp;There was a small glimmer of hope for the Village as the match tailed off, with tension and drama.&nbsp;It was to be too little too late though.&nbsp;Southwark and Lambeth are the second team to see off the Village this season, who have now slipped down the ladder, promotion chances thrown into disarray.&nbsp;A close game is a good game and this was a close game.&nbsp;The home team richly deserved their victory and we thank them for a providing a tremendous contest.&nbsp;It was a game of two halves and full credit to the opposition.</div>
