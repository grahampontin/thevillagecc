<p>A game of ups and downs for The Village ultimately ended in defeat to Island Community CC at 'Fortress' Springfield.</p>
<p>On a beautiful afternoon in the Hackney park, the mood was buoyant thanks in part to the return from Africa of Olly Morgans and the fact that John Lucarotti won the toss after being asked by captain Pontin to do the honours.</p>
<p>There were also memories of the early season defeat of Island, so the team were very much up as they took to the field - despite the non-appearance of Rob Sibson.</p>
<p>A quick call revealed Sibo would be able to come to the party in a couple of hours time, so the Village's much heralded eunuch began bowling in positive mood to a field that was one man short.</p>
<p>Wickets fell fairly regularly, with all the bowlers making wicket-taking contributions. But the up-and-down theme revealed itself in the field - the catches went up, and they came down again. This despite some excellent snaffling from David Ireland in the slips and Olly Morgans at cover. Island amassed 162, but it was a good track and it didn't seem too daunting a total. Mood: up.</p>
<p>Then came the batting. The captain was confident that his side batted &quot;all the way down to 10&quot;, but sadly they seemed intent on proving it as quickly as possible. Strobes was bowled, amazingly, through his legs, and GC Pontin was triggered by Andy despite vehement claims that there was an inside edge. Mood: down.</p>
<p>The stage was set for someone to come in and really take hold of a very useful attack, and all eyes fell on the returning hero Morgans. He lasted an awful long time at the crease but sadly contributed just one run, and once Lucarotti and Bowman had been dismissed following entertaining knocks of 11 and 30 respectively the Village were very much like a terrible golfer - struggling to break 100.</p>
<p>Wickets fell, and they fell, and they fell, until the Island finally found themselves faced with the Village's one-man tail. Eyebrows had been raised on the boundary when quintessential No 11 Woodhouse began giving coaching tips on how to play a square cut, and they continued going up at his assertion that 60 runs was an easy target with no wickets left in hand.</p>
<p>When he strode out confidently to join Sibo at the crease, one of the fielders actually sniggered at the suggestion that the batting pair should take the target &quot;10 runs at a time&quot;. The mirth was well placed - four balls later Sibo had his off stump clipped back, and the Village had slumped to defeat.</p>
<p>There was only really one candidate for man-of-the-match, as only one man contributed with both bat and ball. Step forward Kiwi Paul Edith Bowman.</p>
<p>*It should be noted that the Village would definitely, DEFINITELY have won this game had it not been for a disgraceful piece of deception. Incidentally, rumours that A-Bomb was batting for another side were also confirmed.</p>
