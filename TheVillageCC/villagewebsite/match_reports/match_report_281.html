<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The Village eagerly anticipated Santa and his Pecos XI coming to town. But as Villagers made their way to the Regents park hub, a muggy morning descended into a heavy rain storm, despite Pitcher&rsquo;s assurances. Some well prepared villagers arrived clad in kagools, others looking like drowned rats. Tommo in particular arrived sodden, but his new skinny jeans lifted the gloom, causing some what of a sartorial stir in the Village. Gem Gems appears to be changing her man. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The weather soon turned, Troj lost yet another toss and the Village went out to field an hour or so late. &nbsp;Thommo got the first wicket in the blink of an eye. So spellbound was the opening bat, by the &lsquo;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">gorgeous point</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&rsquo;, that he hit the ball straight to him. Cressey taking it at the second attempt. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The Village quickly turned the screw. New boy Bosshardt was a shining light in the field, taking an athletic catch diving forward as well as running out the non-striker. &nbsp;He also showed Thommo how to bowl pace. Santa batted solidly from one end, as at the other a succession of batsman came and went. Naz, Bilal and Bosshardt all bowling well and taking wickets. Cressey also disappeared into the deep for some reason. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The Pecos XI struggled to cope. Maybe the cold got to the opposition. Unaccustomed it seemed to the English &lsquo;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">summer&rsquo;, </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">the batsmen shivered into the middle, in most of the clothes they could find to hand. &nbsp;</span></p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The Village saw off the last vestiges of resistance due a wonderful spell from Toby, bowling as well as he ever has for the Village. He took the prized wicket of Santa with a genuine edge before seeing off the tail to keep the opposition under 100. Special mention to Graeme Pontin for fielding deep mid-wicket at both ends and new keeper Torj for conceding no byes (as he told us).</span></p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The Village got off to a quick start with both openers Cressey and Toby hitting some classy shots. The Village were over half way to the target in a blink of an eye. Having played some classy sweeps, Toby got a little carried away and nicked off on a charge.</span></p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">With under 20 runs now needed, the game was all but secure. In came Bosh who failed to Bosh, and then Morgs was bowled by the ball of the century.* Finally, Graham arrived at the crease as usual looking to play some carnival cricket. The chase was all but accomplished with the only question being would Cressey get his 50 before the match was over. &nbsp;Graham put paid to that, taking a beamer off his nose for a 4 and securing an easy Village victory.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">We retired to drink at the Engineers. As is becoming the norm, our chat cleared the pub garden of all other customers. The Village awaits its ASBO.</span></p>
