<div class=report_title>Match Report</div>
<div style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt">It is a peculiarity of the game of cricket that certain venues are entirely defined by the exploits of certain players. Any left handed batsman who plies his trade in Antigua, for instance, knows that his achievements will pale into significance when compared with those of the great B.C. Lara. Likewise, what leg spinner would wish to bowl at Sydney with the shadow of one S.K. Warne&rsquo;s performances looming over him?</div>
<div style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt">So it is at Marrowmas (formerly Bartlemas), a pleasant ground off Oxford&rsquo;s Cowley Road that, for three remarkable summers, bore witness to the exploits of one M. Littlejohns. For here it was that this extraordinary cricketer tore all before him to pieces as batsman, keeper and latterly Captain of Oriel&rsquo;s Outcasts Cricket Team. Leaving a trail of salivating ladies and broken-hearted bowlers in his wake, he averaged well over 400 (approx). This is a field of dreams; and the dreams were all his, lived out to the full. Surely this would be a game without any of the famed VCC batting frailties?</div>
<div style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt">The fact that Marrow was available, nay primed, to return to his old kingdom was good news to Captain Bomb, who was struggling to put a team out. On the Wednesday he had 13. On the Thursday he had 9. On the Friday he had eleven, followed by 50 (due to a chance encounter between Page and a sports drinking society), and by the time the game began he was back to 9. All sorts of excuses had been proffered. One nameless villager was gardening, another had a family emergency, and excuse of the day went to Aussie ringer Tim, about whom Bomb knew little other than that he worked in the House of Commons. </div>
<div style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t do it mate. My boss has a lot on his plate.&rdquo;</div>
<div style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt">&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your boss? Can&rsquo;t be that serious can it?&rdquo;</div>
<div style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s David Davis.&rdquo;</div>
<div style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt">There were other problems. We were deeply concerned about the weather. There had been overnight rain, and the forecast for the day was far from sunny. But the A.White memorial covers (Bomb&rsquo;s one contribution to Oriel cricket) had done their job, and the rain was holding off. The outfield was as damp as a female&rsquo;s gusset after 5 minutes in a lift with Marrow, but we wouldn&rsquo;t let that stop us. The Demijohns lent us two children who had the misfortune to be the spawn of a Competitive Dad (who spent the entire game shouting &ldquo;coaching&rdquo; at them while running out his batting partners and bowling pies), and we were off.</div>
<div style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt">Tight opening spells from Bomb and squeaking Cumbrian lunatic Mark Stevenson kept the batsman honest, but while the run rate was slow, Competitive Dad and his beleaguered partner were steadfast. While the batting was extremely dull, the greasy outfield was proving a constant source of amusement, as the Villagers attempted a string of increasingly preposterous and unnecessary sliding stops, above all one S.Reid, who managed to turn a certain two into a wholly unexpected four. By this point we had almost forgotten this was Marrowmas, but Littlejohns reminded us by swooping at point and hitting the stumps with about half an inch to aim at to claim the first wicket. Simply extraordinary.</div>
<div style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt">It was the bowling change that brought the next reward, Nick enticing the batsman into a loose drive which was taken brilliantly by Page in the gully. Nick&rsquo;s spell was nagging, straight and extremely testing. At the other end, McClarence was bowling quickly and accurately for little reward, spurred on by some &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; banter behind the stumps. </div>
<div style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt">We took lunch (kindly prepared by Page and Stevo), and the Demijohns had not yet reached 100 and were three down. When we came back out, they attempted to slog their way towards a competitive total, but the bowling of Koder and Reid held them in check &ndash; bowling to their fields and using the ground&rsquo;s slope, they were hard to get away and sparked a mini collapse. Saul frustrated the DJs&rsquo; best batsman into a loose drive that was well taken by Monkey behind the stumps, and bowled extremely accurately to take three wickets, far and away his best performance with the ball for the Village thus far. However, the DJs regrouped and crawled to 193, finally hitting a few boundaries off Stevo upon his return. Excellent bowling from all with a wet ball in tricky conditions, all catches held: this was a performance to be proud of against one of the stronger batting teams we&rsquo;ll play this year.</div>
<div style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt">The openers, Page and Monkey, were dispatched with a license to attack. Page duly set about the bowling with a series of flashing square drives and wristy cuts, all of which would have been even better if he&rsquo;d connected with the ball. After a couple of thumping leg side hits, Monkey&rsquo;s was the first wicket to fall, a victim of the second excellent gully catch of the day. Next to go was Andy, lbw despite being a long way forward to their pacy opening bowler. He claimed an inside edge. The umpire (nameless) claimed otherwise. </div>
<div style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt">Cometh the hour, cometh the Marrow. What would it be? A flashy 100, or an elegant one? To everyone&rsquo;s surprise, he went early on, bowled by a huge off cutter. The pitch had changed over the course of the game. The water had left it, and it was showing its true colours: while it was flat, the dry grass made it a veritable bunsen. The DJs captain spotted this straight away and put on his spinners. One was very good. The second &ndash; well. The ball left his hand and went up in the air. And up. And up. And up. And began to come down. And down. And finally landed on the pad of Page, who in the elapsed time had filed his tax returns, made a cup of tea and played about 6 shots before settling on an ill advised hoick. That he was bang in front of the stumps was indisputable. Whether the ball would have had enough pace to knock the bails off was not. </div>
<div style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt">Four down, Bomb and Nick in: we were now playing for the draw. The DJs stuck with their spinners, one bowling fizzing leg breaks and googlies (one of the latter ripped back half a foot through Nick&rsquo;s defences &ndash; five down), the other throwing it even higher than MMJ could possibly imagine, and daring us to smack it. Saul came and went to him, inside edging a rare quicker one back onto the stumps, and MK Don and Bomb had 16 overs to survive.</div>
<div style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt">That they got through 13 of them was due to an heroic innings by the Don, who at first wanted to be kept away from the strike, but who by the end had grown in confidence so much that he was quite happily running singles, even hitting the odd boundary. The spirit of Johannesburg 95 had been evoked. The DJs threw everything at them, including amusingly surnamed seamers (it&rsquo;s not easy batting when the entire slip corden is shouting &ldquo;Well bowled, Darling&rdquo;), and finally Martin went to a mistimed shot through midwicket off the returning opener &ndash; a sign of the confidence he&rsquo;d gained while playing a vital innings.</div>
<div style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt">Three overs to go. Last man Mark Stephenson came in. Bomb wasn&rsquo;t confident he could cope with the opener. Stevo was. He was less so after the first one crashed into his crackers, but saw out the over. Two overs to go, with Bomb on strike. He survived five balls, but wanted a single off the sixth. A scampered leg bye left him facing the last over, bowled by the increasingly focussed Darling. The remaining six balls were negotiated safely, and the draw was secure, to everyone&rsquo;s delight.</div>
<div style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt">All that remained was for the DJs to stay in the middle for a few overs while Competitive Dad bowled a few bouncers at and sledged his own children, before a jaunt to the pub for beers and burgers. Several members of the VCC were reportedly spotted at 1am in the Purple Turtle celebrating the draw by dancing to Haddaway, 2 Unlimited and Urban Cookie Collective, but their identities have not been established. One Dr. F. Bell was reportedly overheard describing it as a musical &ldquo;golden patch&rdquo;.</div>
<div style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt">Man of the Match is a tough one, but Saul gets it for an extremely accurate and containing spell of bowling that stopped the DJs getting away from us. </div>
<div style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt">Village Idiot is hard. A-Rich is in the mix for his excuse as to why he didn&rsquo;t bother running after a ball that went down to the third man boundary: &ldquo;Ah, well, now, you see, I thought it was going for four, but then realised it wasn&rsquo;t, and as I hadn&rsquo;t started running in the first place I thought it would be embarrassing to then start.&rdquo; But in an unprecedented move Saul has to take it too: uncertain as to whether he should really be defending the filth thrown up by the DJs second &ldquo;spinner&rdquo;, he succeeded in edging it onto his stumps, resulting in a dismissal that looked like a real life super slo-mo replay. Coupled with his sliding fielding efforts, he&rsquo;s a deserving winner. A great day, thanks to Stevo, Page and Dave The Groundsman: here&rsquo;s to next year.</div>
