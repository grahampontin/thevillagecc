<conditions><p>Pleasant day. Low, turning pitch.</p> </conditions><p>To Highgate Woods, then, to play Strong Room. The pitch looked a belter,  but within a few balls it became clear it was going to be very hard  work to make a big score - it took sharp turn from ball one and the  bounce was extremely low. Pleas for the VCC Mongoose have hitherto gone  unheeded by our Iron Chancellor, and in the absence of any shovels in  the kit bag it was clear our batsmen were going to have their work cut  out. Huge credit, then, has to go to Tarka and Farmer McDonald for the  way they handled the opening exchanges. With the seamers struggling to  find their line there were a lot down the leg side, and those that  weren't were proving very hard to time. They made the first 100 opening  partnership for the Village in a very long time (no idea when the last  one was), with Sam spanking it everywhere and Hindle more cautious,  though there were a couple of sweet off drives in there.<br />
<br />
Sadly the innings began to tail away with the introduction of  left-arm spinner Joe, who bowled a brilliant spell to turn the game  around. Flighting the ball craftily and giving it a real rip, he first  beat Tarka in the flight to pick up a catch at mid off, then  comprehensively did Sam with one that dipped on him (so comprehensively  that, having looked entirely solid, he fell arse over tit in a bid to  hammer it for six). Morgs then cut one straight to short extra cover,  and for his last and best trick he produced a lovely arm ball which  useful lower order hitter Troja left alone, only to watch it peg back  off stump.<br />
<br />
This left Bomb and debutant Kaso to mount a rebuilding exercise,  which they did cautiously, trading in singles before Kaso spooned one up  in the air. Becker for once failed to deliver lower order runs, beaten  by a huge off cutter. The Strong Room bowlers had realised that on this  pitch there was nothing to be gained by sending the ball down seam up  and were running their fingers down every delivery, some of them ragging  off the pitch by half a foot. Bomb played and missed but held up an  end, and Gupte came in and played a superb innings. The off cutters  breaking back into him played to his strength, and he was able to whip  them through and over the leg side. As he said afterwards, he felt very  much at home on that wicket.<br />
<br />
23 might not sound a huge score but in the context of the game it was  probably the defining innings, Sam's apart. Strong Room knew 150 would  be a defensible total, but thanks to Ek we were well over that mark by  the time the innings came to an end with a comedy run out - Boa charging  down the wicket off the last ball of the innings and AB remaining  rooted to his crease, not wishing to part company with his red ink. <br />
<br />
The Village took a fine tea confident they could defend the total.  Boa and Becker started parsimoniously, stringing together maidens. It  took four overs for Strong Room to get off the mark. Becker was the  first to break through, piercing the opener's defences with a brilliant  yorker and picking up another thanks to a sharp catch from Tarka.  However, Strong Room's captain began to play some excellent shots after a  cautious start, and the nerves began to jangle. Martin came on and  bowled a good spell, trapping the number four LBW, but the captain  motored on and received support from the number five. It took a spell of  sustained pressure from Ek and Martin to dislodge him, the dipping run  rate forcing a run out, coolly completed by the Louse. <br />
<br />
Ek now went to work, dislodging the number six with a stunning  leg-break, and the Louse bowled a fantastically economical spell, tying  the batsmen in knots and being very unlucky not to pick up a wicket.  Troja was the next to come on and he kept the pressure up, beating  successive batsmen with perfectly pitched wrong 'uns, and despite some  late hitting from the lower order the game was all but up.<br />
<br />
It was a great performance from all concerned, showing application with  the bat on a difficult wicket, and a testament to the adaptability of  our bowling attack, which made perfect use of the conditions. Morgans  also did a sterling job as stand-in keeper.<br />
<br />
Many thanks to Strong Room, who offer a great pitch, a fine tea and are a great bunch to go for beers with after. One of the best fixtures of the season.<br />
<br />
Man of the Match: Sam was the only person to pass 25 in the whole game,  but he's just edged out by Gupte, who applied the finishing touches and  was our best bowler.</p>
