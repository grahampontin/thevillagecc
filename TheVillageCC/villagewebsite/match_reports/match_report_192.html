<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">On the hottest day of the year, Young Village skipper Ilyas won the toss and elected to bat first on a slow South Park wicket.&nbsp; Bilal and Donald got the Youngsters off to a solid start against Veteran Kiwi quicks Bowman and Hampton.&nbsp; Hampton was fired up after a close LBW appeal against Bilal was turned down and a sharp chance behind the wicket was grassed the following ball. &nbsp;The hungover Oldies struck soon after though, claiming the key wicket of the ever dangerous Donald off Bowman, thanks to a good diving forward (over the zimmer frame) catch.</span></p>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Enter the greatest batsman to ever call himself a Villager in his trademark Red Shorts.&nbsp; Despite having sipped pina coladas in some of Soho&rsquo;s finest establishments until the early hours, Troja was in his typical stodgey early innings form, allowing the aggressive Bilal keep the run rate above 6 an over. &nbsp;The two put on an 80 run partnership until Bilal was stumped by hungover stag Hindle off the bowling of Koder for a well compiled 49.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Thus Troja accelerated, launching 2 sixes on his way to 50 retired, while Gupte and Ilyas came and went in relative quick succession trying to lift the run rate further. &nbsp;And just when the Oldies felt a strong comeback was on the cards, the impressive Becker came to the crease and showed his class with a quick fire 40, ably supported with 15 from the ever improving Woodhouse, and stylish 14 from Pitcher.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">The innings finished after the allotted 35 overs with the Youngsters 5-219.&nbsp; The score could have either been a lot more* or a lot less had the Oldies not dropped 10 catches, mostly off the bowling of Hampton.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">After a quick break Simson and White started the Oldies reply. &nbsp;Becker and Woodhouse spearheaded the Youngsters attack and both bowled impressively, providing few scoring opportunities and extracting prodigious movement out of the pitch. &nbsp;The scoreboard pressure became too much to opener White (9), who attempted to loft Woodhouse down the ground but only exceeded in skying the ball to mid off, 1-20 off 5 overs. &nbsp;This brought the classy Littlejohns to the wicket, however his lack of match practice this year proved his undoing as Becker managed to find a gap between bat and pad to send him on his way for 2.</span></p>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">The former best Australian Village batsman joined Simson at the crease and Simson led the way with some elegant cover drives for 4.&nbsp; Meanwhile Harty was looking shaky and none to pleased about the incessant sledging from the slip cordon - marvelous effort that.&nbsp; Simson (20) fell soon after, and the Oldies were in trouble at 3-40.&nbsp; Hindle joined Harty and was looking in great form, advancing down the wicket at every opportunity, however his stand didn't last long, presenting a simple catch to the Youngsters.&nbsp; Bowman then arrived at the crease and looked good before Bilal slipped one through Bowman's brittle defenses, 5-45.&nbsp; Hampton arrived at the wicket and was keen to continue his season objective of scoring 90% of his runs in sixes.&nbsp; The crowd was somewhat stunned when he got off the mark first ball with a single, but d&eacute;j&agrave; vu ensued as the following over the familiar pattern of 6, swish, out materialised, 6-52.</span></p>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Koder joined Harty and the pair attempted to consolidate to avoid further embarrassment to the senior players of the club.&nbsp; Harty finally started to see one ball instead of 3 and moved along to 20, and Koder demonstrated solid defense and the pair remained not out at drinks.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">The Youngsters, sensing victory was within their grasp, went for the kill bringing Troja and Ilyas into the attack. &nbsp;However Harty was up to the challenge launching a Troja full toss into the adjacent postcode, and took 15 off the following Ilyas over. &nbsp;Jitters went through the Youngsters camp and the experienced Gupte was brought into the attack. &nbsp;Harty attempted to hit a straight 6 first ball and was lucky to survive as Troja uncharacteristically dropped a difficult chance.&nbsp; Koder finally fell to a brilliant one-handed-diving-backwards catch from Becker, and skipper Francis came to the wicket and batted with composure as the two oldest Villagers tried to steal an unlikely victory.&nbsp; However death bowler Gupte finally bowled Francis, leaving Harty stranded on 67 not out, and Old Village all out for 135.</span></p>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Congratulations to Young Village for a strong all round effort and an emphatic 84 run victory.&nbsp; The Old Village was certainly not at their best, but it was clear the better team won on the day.</span></p>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Man of the Match: Bilal for a quick 49 and 2 key wickets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">* had Troja come back in score would have been 240+</span></p>
