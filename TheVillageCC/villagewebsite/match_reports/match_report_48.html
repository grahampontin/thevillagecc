<div class=report_title>Match Report</div>
Despite Sunday being the wettest day in England for 50 years, the plucky villagers made their way to the hallowed ground of Springfield Park for a frenetic game of Twenty20 against the intriguingly named (Millennium) Falcon. They were duly rewarded for their devotion as The Gods smiled upon them and stayed off the torrential rains that drowned the rest of the country until late in the afternoon. <br />
<br />
<br />
Upon winning the toss, (and with some dubious advice from some of the less experienced cricketers) stand-in captain ex-marathon-man John Lucaroti decided to bat first. This came as much as a surprise to the semi-enthusiastic members of his team as it did the opposition. <br />
<br />
<br />
The main reason for this being that the ground was damp, it was drizzling and the more clairvoyant members of the team realised it would be drying up around about the time the oppo would be sent in to bat. One northerner was heard gasping &ldquo;WHAT&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.?&rdquo; <br />
<br />
<br />
The captain defended the decision by pointing out that we only had 8 men (and The A Bomb) and should, therefore, bat first so as to give Saul and Sibbo time to get to the ground. Little did he know that they would never turn up. Sibbo was lost altogether and Saul was busy having a barny with the wife who had locked him out of the house. The pair were duly named joint Village Idiot for their troubles by the Marathon Man. <br />
<br />
<br />
Without their nuggety Scots captain to &lsquo;see off the new ball and receive a customary bang on the head&rsquo;, The Village turned to the man from The Valleys, &lsquo;Deano&rsquo; to partner the thing that is &lsquo;The Bomb&rsquo;. <br />
<br />
<br />
As the first bowler trundled in, Bomb considered all his options and, unusually, chose a forward defensive before the ball had even been released. The response from the pavilion was mocking calls of &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a test match!&rdquo; Researchers have been working through the night to discover whether this was the earliest ever such occurrence of the chant that is fast becoming a Village favourite. <br />
<br />
<br />
The early going was somewhat predictable with Deano either playing and missing or hitting a four (one of which was superbly guided through second slip, a passing translator&rsquo;s claim that the opposition were saying the word &ldquo;streaky&rdquo; was proved unfounded) and some technical nurdling from The Bomb. <br />
<br />
<br />
However, onlookers were astonished by the big mans speed across the ground. Well known for his calls of &lsquo;Waiting&rsquo; and &lsquo;NNNOOO!&rsquo;, the A Bomb was forced into a canter by the intelligent early calls from the Welsh-man who was already half-way down the track. <br />
<br />
<br />
The analysis from the &lsquo;Man-in-the-Van&rsquo; focused on the possibility of these two forming a solid partnership in future, rather than the regular opening pair who have caused several aneurisms among the audience due to their cautious running; or lack thereof. <br />
<br />
<br />
Upon the dismissal of Alan &lsquo;A Bomb&rsquo; White (for 10) to a jaffer of a ball which seamed into him and removed the leg stump (it was noted by onlookers that this was The Bomb&rsquo;s first attempt at a slog in the match, hence proving that his defensive style is borne out of necessity rather than desire) the overseas quota player, Paul &lsquo;KP&rsquo; Bowman stepped into the breach and put on the highest score by a Village player that day with an excellent 21. <br />
<br />
<br />
The highlight of his innings came shortly before he was clean bowled when he dispatched the ball back over the bowler&rsquo;s head for a meaty six. What particularly delighted the combative Kiwi was the clunk when the ball smashed into the side of a people carrier parked on the road. Specks of blue paint were found on the ball for several overs. <br />
<br />
<br />
Before the fall of KP, Deano was dismissed when he attempted another big four and was caught on 9. This brought up to the crease the amusingly monikered stand-in keeper &lsquo;Fudge&rsquo;. The entire ground then watched in amazement as he somehow survived nineteen balls of (mainly) playing and missing to score 5. <br />
<br />
<br />
The usual middle order collapse then followed with four wickets falling for 9 runs. The first man to go was the captain, MMJ. After two hefty heaves back over the bowlers head and looking like he was set for a 20 odd score, the captain was caught napping and run out for 3. <br />
<br />
<br />
Then followed the H-Prep who was promptly dismissed for 1 trapped in front. Moans of &ldquo;I hit it&rdquo; were heard by the outfield as he trudged back to the pavilion. The scorer gladly recorded the fall of wicket as &ldquo;Taste of own medicine&rdquo;. The legendary ex-opener Ed T made a cameo appearance in the lower order without too much success unfortunately. After tickling some singles around he was bowled for 4. <br />
<br />
<br />
The last hope for any kind of defendable score now rested with ex-captain Richardson &ldquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&ldquo;Andy&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo; Richardson. However, his run of poor form with the bat continued as he was bowled second ball for 1 when he attempted an almighty heave over long off. Unfortunately this time, the ball, which had been turning away, was cunningly spun in by the bowler and the final Village wicket fell as there were only 9 batsman. <br />
<br />
<br />
Page did not have to face a single ball as The Village were disgracefully skittled for 57 (Frank scored 5). <br />
<br />
<br />
After a short break and a team cuddle&hellip;sorry huddle, the mighty Village prepared to defend the indefensible; (insert your own joke here). The difficulty of the task soon became apparent as the oppo&rsquo;s opening batsmen proceeded to slap our opening bowlers around. <br />
<br />
<br />
An early chance did fall to the Prep who took a moment too long to work out the flight of the ball which had been sliced high into the air. He was always struggling after that and, despite a valiant dive forward through the &lsquo;merde&rsquo; and getting one hand onto the ball, it wasn&rsquo;t held. <br />
<br />
<br />
The batsmen continued to pile on the runs. Then the second chance came, this time it was a thick edge off of KP&rsquo;s &lsquo;slower than normal&rsquo; bowling. The ball flew to gully were Page was dozing and he barely moved until the ball was past him. This appeared to weigh heavily on his mind as his fielding thereafter was not up to his usual standards. <br />
<br />
<br />
Finally! One of the openers skied a shot off of A Bomb to Deano at long on. It was said by one passing old man with a dog that &ldquo;that was the most relaxed catch I have ever seen.&rdquo; The second opener went the same way, but it was looking dismal for the 9 man team: 32 for 2. <br />
<br />
<br />
It was then that an inspired bowling change was made by Lucaroti. Deano and McClarence were brought in to ruffle the new batsmen. On his first ball of his first over Deano took a much needed wicket. The batsmen had turned square on to the ball and caught it between his thighs! After some generous LBW decisions from the Village umpires in the first innings, the oppo umpire felt compelled to return the favour and raised his finger with a gleeful smile. <br />
<br />
<br />
Deano completed the over with some excellently flighted balls to gain a wicket maiden. Although he didn&rsquo;t take another wicket, he did finish with an impressive 1 for 7 from 3 overs. <br />
<br />
<br />
Andy amazingly repeated the feat by tempting the batsmen into playing with his very first ball. On any other day it would have gone for four, but Deano was feeling inspired. In a Man-of-the-Match performance, he fell to his left and grabbed the ball one handed two inches off the floor. Richardson was speechless. <br />
<br />
<br />
Another batsmen was caught for 0 shortly after from Andy&rsquo;s bowling and there were hushed murmurs of a shock win. One spectator commented that the oppo was &ldquo;in danger of dropping their shopping.&rdquo; Andy finished with some excellent figures of 2 for 4 from 2. <br />
<br />
<br />
However, the flourish was over and the next two batsmen quickly knocked off the remaining twelve runs required. Though, in an excellent impression of the ICC, the scorers where unsure as to what the score was and the bemused cricketers stood in confusion for 30 seconds before a muted cheer came up from the sidelines. The Village had been vanquished. <br />
<br />
<br />
Due to the swiftness with which we had been dispatched, it was agreed that we would play again; in a &lsquo;sweet sixteen&rsquo; match. This was a torrid affair, with very little for the Village lads to be proud of. It was an unwanted return to the dark days of 2003-04 and the fielding that &lsquo;graced&rsquo; that season. There were several impersonations of the Key Stone Cops that resulted in fours; most notably from KP and Page. <br />
<br />
<br />
The nine men of The Village were reduced to eight when there were calls for some of the non-regular bowlers to turn their arms over and Ed T decided to retire as the oppo was not wearing helmets and he feared for their safety should he unleash &lsquo;The Fireworks&rsquo;. <br />
<br />
<br />
He was replaced by an opposition player who at first appeared to be un-enthusiastic in the field, but with hindsight it is clear he was just playing to the standard that the rest of us were performing at. When we were batting, he also pulled off the most celebrated and gentlemanly action of the day when he resolutely held his ground (and crease) and ran out The Bomb. <br />
<br />
<br />
The only other moments of note were: the constant and vicious sledging between slip fielder A Bomb and the unsteady keeper, Fudge, and the comical run out for the Packer; Deano having his off-stump comprehensively lifted out of the ground and landing 5 feet behind him; and one ex-captain having much admiration for and praising Page&rsquo;s &lsquo;impressive length&rsquo;, although Page didn&rsquo;t appear to know how to use it properly as he ended with 1 for 22 off of 3. <br />
<br />
<br />
The Falcon posted a daunting 132 and The Village looked in trouble. The umpire did offer the light to Page near the end of the innings, but he held steadfast and vowed to continue on stating that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only spin, I can see it&rdquo;, obviously forgetting an important part of cricket; that you have to hit it as well. <br />
<br />
<br />
The only redemption for the despondent, demoralized and downright hapless Village cricketers was that when the last wicket fell, they had reached the promised land of 69. <br />
