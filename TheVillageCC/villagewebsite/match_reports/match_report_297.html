<conditions><p>Stony. Windy.</p> </conditions><p>At sometime around 8:20am, Thomo had WhatApp'd me, asking &quot;are you up?&quot;. I wasn't. I had been added to a new group ominously named &quot;Emergency&quot;. Something was clearly Very Wrong. Surely we could not have two Villagers in A&amp;E in the space of a week?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>All that had actually occurred was that Thomo had been foolishly let loose in a curry house without Ek's guiding hand, leading to what<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/alanwhite/the-cheekiest-week-of-all#.lxOj9NxM8"> journalists sometimes describe as passing a shotgun blast of lava</a> - but from both ends.</p>
<p>Hence stand-in skipper Thomo was out and stand-in stand-in skipper Harty - possibly playing his last ever game for the Village - was, er. stood up. Somehow we drafted in Naz as our eleventh player at the eleventh hour.</p>
<p>The wicket was verdant and rock solid, partly due to the fact that it had actual rocks in. One HACer, standing as umpire, took particular exception to one specific monolith in the pitch, and in between overs picked away diligently at it with his keys until it was successfully unearthed and tossed aside, ready to be rolled into a different pitch which we may use later in the season.</p>
<p>Keen readers will have picked up on the fact that the oppo umpiring implies that HAC batted first, in this instance having won the toss and perhaps hoping for some of that good ol' scoreboard pressure.</p>
<p>Chadwick and Hampton opened our bowling attack and both were soon getting excellent swing from the fresh cherry in an oft stiff breeze. Faj was fortunate to survive nicking off to Chadwick early doors, only to be dropped by fourth choice* keeper Pitcher diving to his left. This took Pitcher up to a disgraceful tally of five drops in succession for the Village, but one that was to not last long, since Faj than obliged to hit the ball gently straight up in the air off the same bowler to present a chance that even C-pitch could not miss. </p>
<p>More early wickets fell as Ben cleaned up Patel who had not troubled the scores, then Harty - having replaced Ben due to a toenail malfunction - had Sherland caught by Abrar at square leg for 8. So far, so good.</p>
<p>About an hour and 117 runs later, Village took their fourth wicket, danger man Watt perishing to an excellent juggled effort by Chris Burke that went up in the air twice as the player went down to the ground only for the ball to lodge on his hip. This rapidly turned into a double-breakthrough, as the other run scorer, Casey, was caught by MeHarty off BOSH. There may also have been some catches dropped during this period, oh and a RUN&nbsp;OUT! I almost forgot the bloody run out again. Yes, Ben ran someone out, which was particularly impressive given that both batsmen were pretty much down the end that Ben threw at, and yet somehow neither of them were in the crease at the time.</p>
<p>Bilal managed to get a couple of chaps out by hitting the stump over with some nice in-swingers, then Death Bowler Ollie Bowl also had a chapped Balled with a vintage two-bounce skidder into the base of middle stump, reminiscent of the Village at Springfield Park circa 2008.</p>
<p>After their 40 overs HAC had posted a decent 227-9. Village went in to bat, and were generally stodgy. Naz and BOSH opened. Naz hung around for a bit before getting bowled. Abrar came in, hung around for a bit, then was also bowled. Harty came and went, gloving behind to the keeper off a swinging ball that was generally agreed by all that saw it to be quite a good 'un. His was the first scalp to be claimed by Lawson, who frankly bowled like a typewriter driven by an expert and beautiful secretary who is probably sex crazed like a character out of Mad Men, rhythmically methodical and irresistibly tempting, leading a succession of Village batsmen to their doom for bugger-all runs (8-1-14-4).</p>
<p>Village were in trouble at drinks, only 67 runs on the board and 5 wickets down. The slump continued to 88-7 off 24 overs. Ben and Pitcher managed to steady the ship a bit, Hampton looking increasingly composed in making a decent 36 before edging behind. Sam elected to bat low down and came in at eleven, and managed to accumulate 25 before Pitcher was caught and bowled at the other end for the same score (his career best for the Village). VCC were all out for 181 from 38.3 overs. Bosh may also have been triggered by C-pitch at some point when well set on 21.</p>
<p>During the final wicket stand, a tourist took it upon themselves to wander on to the pitch, almost up on to the wicketkeeper's shoulder in order to take a picture of the action.</p>
<p>After the game, some Villagers strolled up to the Engineer for beers, speeches and pies that were still frozen in the middle.</p>
<p>Farewell to Steve Harty. Hopefully this will prove not to be his last game for the Village as he may pick up one or two more on visits back to these shores in the future, but whatever happens, we can be certain that very few players will ever get near his amazing career total of over 3,000 runs for the Village. All the best for the future mate.</p>
