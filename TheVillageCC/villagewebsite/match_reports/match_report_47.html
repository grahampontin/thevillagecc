<br />
The day began with the rather ominous sight of The Coach already on the field warming up, motivated, full of energy and keen on revenge. On the otherhand, the Village trickled in and after much talk decided a warm up of our own was in order. Our coin cursed captain lost the toss again, and the Coach elected to bat first on what was a very green and curiously damp crease. The 'greenkeeper' had obviously decided that golf was a much more fitting game for Springfield Park, and had elected to give the crease a thorough watering prior to the match, giving it the appearance of an oasis in the middle of the dry outfield. With the weather absolutely perfect for a days cricket and everyone in good spirits we started our attack. <br />
<br />
As Morgans was running quite late we borrowed Maj's friend(dad?) to complete our field lineup, with KP and Maj himself opening the bowling. A very contained and solid attack followed with good economy from both bowlers. Then came the breakthrough with Maj bowling a lovely outswinger that clipped outside edge and thanks to a spectacular dive and one handed catch from El Capitan the opener Andrew was gone. Andy took over KP and presently dispatched the other opener Oli very cleanly. The Village looked to be keeping The Coach very well contained. Paul increased the tally with a lovely catch to get Will out, and things were looking up. However, The Coach batsman consisting of Mo and Jon dug their heels in, dispatching Bomb and Dean for some consistant '5 an over' cricket. A couple of easy catches were dropped, and the worm started to turn in The Coaches favour. After finding his length and line, a lovely ball from Saul popped up into the top of off-stump to take out their number four in the form of Mo, which also completing his maiden over. Inspired, Paul then took a great wicket cleanly bowling out Chris, a batsman that looked very settled. However, more wickets were hard to find, and so it stayed until Gordon seized on a running mix up and superbly dribbled the ball in from 6 yards to achieve a run out of Adam. With two overs left, Gordon was in to bowl, and struck again. This time with a delicately placed ball that didn't give the batsman much room for error. His first wicket for The Village, and a very fine one at that! A very mediocre day in the field, with a lot of dropped chances and apparent tired players. Could The Village turn it around with the bat?<br />
<br />
The batting was always going to be tough. Needing 5 runs per over to win, the gauntlet had been set. With this in mind our regular openers Graham and Bomb strode out to the putting green, now nicely decorated with pitch marks(!!??). Perhaps it was the music in the background, or the remote control plane flying overhead, but Bomb was unsettled and quickly fell victim to an outside edge that only just carried to the keeper. Oli Morgans, confident after some good performances recently came in to fill the void. All the while our fearless leader was steadily accumulating runs in the manner only he knows how. His most impressive moment has to be a massive 6. Not an easy task at the large boundary of Springfield Park! But with great power comes great responsibility, and I'm afraid to say he couldn't control it. Two balls later he was back watching from the boundary. Things were looking very bleak. With our openers gone, it was only 25-2. Much hope was put on the Morgan / PK partnership. But it wasn't to be and Oli also fell quickly to a good delivery which took out the offside stump. PK was looking good in the early stages making some quick runs including some great fours. With Dean coming in at 5 to replace Morgan he had a lot to do. But with some confusion in the middle he was run out. A very unlucky wicket to fall, leaving The Village in ruins. Andy came to the crease with a string of below par performances with the bat this season, his confidence at an all time low. However, within minutes proved that he was still capable of firing on all cylinders when needed. Fours and cunning singles followed from both KP and Andy. But with the theme of the day quickly emerging, a wild swing from KP left his stumps in tatters, and with it our chances of winning. It was up to Andy and Rahilly to somehow pull it back. For a while, everything looked good. The runs were piling up and the better bowlers were running out of overs. Could this be the turnaround we all thought impossible? Both batsman were proving rather difficult to get out, and were both hitting the ball well with the full knowledge of the large task that faced them. Unfortunately, it proved too much and Tom went to a catch. Tom was extremely unlucky - playing a pull shot which was well struck but was plucked right off the turf at short mid-on. The last true hope of the innings fell on the Andy/Saul partnership, with Saul having to yet prove himself with the bat for The Village, it was a big ask. Things started well with a four off his second ball and another a few balls later. Many discussions about the best tactics were taken between overs, but ultimately the simple 'smack it if you can' approach was opted for. After a lovely and fairly rapid 40 partnership (in which some catches were dropped) Andy fell victim to the Springfield low bounce, swinging wildly and promptly missing. The end was near. In came Maj, and two balls later out went Maj with a straight delivery to middle stump. Woodlouse confidently strode into the arena looking strangely like Russell Crowe in Gladiator. A shudder went through The Coach field. Saul was to face his nemesis of the match, Mo, whom he had bowled out earlier in the game. He could see the desired vengeance in his eyes. An interesting start to his final over gave The Village two no balls. But with a change of run-in a lovely in-swinger clattered into the stumps. He had his vengeance. So it was all down to Gordon and Craig. A tall order of 50 runs needed to win. With Gordon playing some solid defencive strokes, it was Craig who fell first to straight yorker. <br />
<br />
Even with the loss, a thoroughly enjoyable day was had by all. The Coach were gracious in victory and I am sure I can speak for the whole team when I say that it was one of the friendliest matches we've played all season. Some nice banter out in the middle with good natured play on both sides. Thank goodness the weather held out for once. A very lacklustre fielding approach from The Village, mixed with a calm but steady batting attitude from The Coach made it a differcult game, but ultimately, our inability to bat was our undoing once again. <br />
<br />
'Man Of The Village' goes to Andy &quot;The Cheif&quot; Richardson for some great work with the ball and a very welcome back to form with the bat.<br />
<br />
'Village Idiot' is almost impossible to call as there were so many bad drops and mistakes. But Bomb shall take the pointed hat and T-Shirt this week for his all round 'idiotness'.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've been your host, Saul Reid. I hope you've had a nice time. I sure have! Good night! <br />
