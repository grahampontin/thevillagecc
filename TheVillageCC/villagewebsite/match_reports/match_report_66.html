<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">After last year&rsquo;s no show on the part of the undergraduates, the Village team arrived in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cambridge</st1:place></st1:city> unsure what to expect. The contribution of one Alexander Alfred Page was &lsquo;nothing to worry about&rsquo;. He obviously hadn&rsquo;t actually seen the bowling.<o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">So we arrived at a wonderfully sunny <st1:street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Barton Road</st1:address></st1:street>, beautifully prepared as ever by Keith. It was one of those tosses where the captains would give anything to win it. You&rsquo;ll be surprised to learn, then, that KP called wrong and the Village were asked to field. The decision was an easy one for the <st1:place w:st="on">Queens</st1:place>&rsquo; Captain. <o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">The innings began with <st1:place w:st="on">Queens</st1:place>&rsquo; struggling to get going, reined in by a solidly economical performance from KP. The A Bomb was not exploding, however, struggling to control his length in the face of some wristy stuff from the <st1:place w:st="on">Queens</st1:place>&rsquo; opener. The innings progressed without ever being really out-of-hand for the Village. Queens' were not scoring quickly on a good surface, although they were running the singles hard and turning a lot of them into quick twos. </font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Throughout the innings, Village probably felt that they had kept <st1:place w:st="on">Queens</st1:place> quiet enough to be in with a shout. A double-wicket spell from Chris Pitcher, along with economical spells from Martin and Eklavya meant that Queens&rsquo; achieved what should have been a below-par score, but a couple of expensive overs at the death meant that the target was a competitive 184. Both the spinners, bowling on probably the only pitch that will give them an advantage over the course of the season, bowled well enough to deserve wickets, keeping the batsmen on their toes throughout. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Black marks in the bowling performance for the large&nbsp;number of wides - 27 - which compares very unfavourably with the figure later recorded by Queens' of just nine.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Working hard in the field on a hot Sunday afternoon had obviously not fired the Village for a rampant batting performance. This, couple with a solid tea, seemed to lead to a certain degree of lethargy with the bat. Notwithstanding accurate and difficult opening spells from <st1:place w:st="on">Queens</st1:place>&rsquo; opening bowlers M. A. Chine (Garrett) and Martin &ndash; who kept us down to an unbelievable 13 off the first ten overs &ndash; Village never really took it to Queens&rsquo; in the way that was required. M. A. Chine bowled a comparatively short spell of five overs, one for ten, but his partner&nbsp;Martin was extraordinary, going for just two runs off his first five overs. It was this that went some way to deciding the course of the match - the Village were always behind from here and struggled to up the run rate until the (too) late arrival of KP and Eklavya, as well as the gear-shift achieved by Bomb later in his innings. </font></font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Mentions must go to Alan for his &ndash; in the circumstances &ndash; excellent knock of 46, along with a quickfire 32 from KP Bowman. Sadly it was probably the fall of Alan&rsquo;s wicket, with the Village still requiring 50 off four overs to win, that marked the end of our serious challenge. <o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Nobody had told Eklavya that, though, and he made up for not taking a wicket (despite deserving one) with a series of lusty blows, aimed at the two returning opening bowlers, with at least one smashed to within a foot of being six over the huge straight boundary. <o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Village finished on 174-9, short by eleven runs of a winning total. At times, we didn&rsquo;t appear to deserve to be in with a shout but it is testament to the players involved &ndash; Alan, Paul and Eklavya &ndash; that even with very little help from the other Villagers, it was still a close game. <o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>
