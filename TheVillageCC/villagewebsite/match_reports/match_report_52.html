<br />
To Parliament Hill, then, where an undefeated Village were understandably thrilled at the prospect of playing perennial whipping boys the Old Fallopians. The retired gynaecologists had previously been on the receiving end of two severe pastings from the blade of Sir Roger de Warner and were keen to make amends. The Village CC, sporting to the last, fielded a weaker side than in previous encounters, principally through the cunning tactic of mislaying two of its players - Infinity 'Deep' Stoat and Luxembourg international Rob Sibson - the evening before the game. <br />
<br />
Fortunately the West Country pairing of Navjot and Bomb had caught a midnight bus back to London after a day's cricket, rugby, football and boozing at the playing fields of Bomb's alma mater and arrived just in time for Bomb to be told he was opening the batting (needless to say, in the absence of the Village CC's official tosser our Captain had maintained his magnificent record of incorrect calls). Still, the corpulent left hander was pumped; so pumped that he donned his whites with such vigour he broke them. With a makeshift belt protecting his modesty, he and Pontin strode out to face the music.<br />
<br />
And what music it was. An emerald green pitch that was as damp as an otter's pocket, humid, overcast conditions, a new ball, and two bowlers quite prepared to make use of the aforementioned. Carnage ensued. Within the first few overs and with 11 (or something like that) on the board Pontin, Bomb and Thomas had all had their shit unequivocally ruined by the openers - a canny left armer at one end and a lumbering man mountain at the other, both of whom were swinging it like a brass band on the corner of West Avenue and 51st Street. Where was Sir Warner when we needed him? Had the Village regressed to the bad old days of sub-50 totals?<br />
<br />
But from hereonin we saw the difference between the Village then and now. The pairing of Richardson and Page began a repair job of sorts, with Navjot looking like he could get out any ball and Richardson smiting it with such vigour that he looked like he could get out before Navjot. Which he duly did. Four out of four batsman had been consummated in the stump region, and defeat was on the cards. It was at this point that the sun began to peep out from the clouds, and one man, in the words of Tony Greig, decided it was his turn to come to the porty. <br />
<br />
His name was KP Bowman, and he had introduced himself to the Village as a useful bowler and number 11 batsman. What utter tosh. Within 10 overs KP had slapped the Fallopians to all parts. The alopeciatic antipodean smote most of his runs through the leg side, though there were a couple of elegant extra cover drives in there, and one colossal six. While KP was driving the crowd wild at one end, Navjot was quietly doing his best to settle them down again. His 25 runs required the utmost patience, grit and determination, and not just from the spectators. He finally went to an astounding reflex slip catch - KP went shortly after for 68, which left just enough time for Maj to hit his customary six runs and for Dr Warner and Nige to smash 3 runs between them from the final two overs of the innings.<br />
<br />
A solid repair job, and the Village could feel mighty pleased to have dragged things round. After a hearty tea they took to the field hoping to produce the same kind of movement that had proved their undoing at the the start of the match. KP and Bomb responded, removing both openers for ducks, but thereafter the sun rose higher and higher in the sky, the wicket eased, and the movement disappeared. Celebrity chef Nigel Slater grafted away to score a well-constructed 76, and aggressive South African AK &quot;47&quot; spanked a rustic 36, removing McClarence's toys from his pram in the process. <br />
<br />
Needless to say the Sheffield man eventually took his revenge, brushing his off stump bail with a pearler to send him packing, but the damage had been done, and for all the solid efforts of Maj, Gordon and (for a brief spell) Navjot, we never looked like stopping the Fallopian juggernaut. Our performance was, it must be said, pleasingly earnest - kudos must be given to Messrs Pontin, Richardson and KP for managing to cabbage themselves by failing to adhere to Bomb's First Law Of Cricketing Conduct: avoid the ball at all times.<br />
<br />
The total reached with overs aplenty to spare, all that was left was for team photos and several pints of cider in the pub. A solid performance from a Village side that really did draw the short straw in terms of the conditions. One wonders if we might have innovated a little in our choice of bowlers and field settings, but all in all there were plenty of positives to take from the game: a great recovery with the bat and an enthusiastic effort in the field. And many thanks to the Fallopians for being such nice chaps and giving us such a splendid game/tea.<br />
<br />
Man of the Match: Only one candidate here: KP for his 68 and wicket.<br />
<br />
Village Idiot: Plenty of candidates here, but Pontin has to take it for his failure to win the toss, again. And for getting his stumps ruined. And for cabbaging his knee. And for sounding like Graham Norton.<br />
