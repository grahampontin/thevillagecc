<conditions><p>&nbsp;Grey clouds. Extremely green pitch.</p> </conditions><p class="MsoNormal"><u>Friday pre-match report:</u> Tucker&rsquo;s Grave Inn. Orange nectar: quaffed. Skittles: Skittled. Winner: Dan Plimmer, despite the fact that he looked more ruined than usual. Loser: Marrow who came comprehensively last following a second round duck. Special bus songs: Bohemian Rhapsody, You&rsquo;ve Lost That Lovin&rsquo; Feeling, failed attempts at Common People and Wonderwall.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><u>Match report proper (job):</u> It was a dark, stormy day. It looked like the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse were just around the corner, and they weren&rsquo;t about to mess around. Every weather outlet was united in its opinion: it was going to piss it down harder than Plimmer after 5 pints of his favourite half and half. With the exception of one: the BBC Points West man had, in between announcing that he was opening a charity shop in Melksham tomorrow and that there was a good game of rugby going on in Bristol, found time to announce that it&rsquo;d be &lsquo;just abaat alroight&rsquo; on Saturday.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And how right he was. Not a drop was felt all day, though it did threaten. This was to be our first game at Broughton Gifford, and as is typical for games like this the pitch was, it must be said, somewhat indistinguishable from the outfield. Fortunately the huge amount of overnight rain had taken all the sting out of it, and it was easily the slowest track we&rsquo;ll play on all year.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As is usual for a Village/Friars game, the Village were inserted, and as is often the case, a Tupper quickly had them under pressure. What was rather surprising, however, was the identity of the Tupper in question, for it wasn&rsquo;t Matt but Giles, who has clearly been doing quite a bit of work on his bowling since last he saw us. Opening up with a squeaking Cumbrian lunatic (not the first one we&rsquo;ve heard of this year), he quickly reduced the much vaunted Village top order to 20-3 with a succession of fantastic off-cutters in between some nippy seam up stuff. Harty was trapped on or around the off stump (not that one would wish to question the umpires) and Plims and the Cobra were cleaned up by excellent nip-backers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So far, so Village. But if there&rsquo;s one thing the Village of 2010 has been good at, it&rsquo;s fighting back from tough positions. This time it was the Welsh Love Dragon and Andimus who put together a 50 stand. The WLD showed the restraint that&rsquo;s been his hallmark all year, and Andimus demonstrated what a couple of seasons of playing alongside dour Northerners can do for your game. Page deployed the middle order stroke maker&rsquo;s b&ecirc;te-noir, an accurate elderly spinner, but neither was tempted into an ill-judged heave. KP and Bomb came on, and while both maintained control, there was little nip in the wicket and surprisingly little swing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Andimus finally fell to a misjudged heave across the line against the aforementioned spinner, but that only brought XMMJL to the wicket, who wasted little time in slapping his fellow Jade Goody-alike for a couple of massive sixes, somewhat ruining his figures. There was a bit of consolation for Lee Carsley after the worst ball he bowled all day, a long hop outside off, was poked to cover by Morgs. MMJ eventually fell to him too attempting to smite him for one six too many, but Bun and Lucas added still more useful lower order runs, aided by a couple of dropped catches, one of which saw Stevo paying a mini homage to fellow Cumbrian Raoul Moat.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A very passable tea was taken, and the FFs began their pursuit of 160. Ekkie, seeing the slow pace of the pitch, made the decision to open with himself and C-Mon, and both reaped rewards, Caddick finding just enough movement to ensure KP played on and trapping Eksteen LBW, while at the other end the Example was proving incredibly tough to get away on the slow pitch. Bomb went for a sweep and was given LBW to one he thought pitched outside leg (and first slip thought was missing off), prompting a rather unsavoury cider-hangover induced tantrum. It should be made clear that he and the man who sent him packing (squarking Stevenson) bonded over still more cider that evening.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Of the rest of the game, perhaps less need be said. As is usually the way, Marrow got on the cut shot for a well-made 29 while the Further Friars got on the wine and beers. Andimus and Lukas bowled very well together to grab four wickets between them, and the writing was on the wall.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">However, it wasn&rsquo;t all over, as retired Man o&rsquo; War Tanous and drunk Westcountryman AAP clung on grimly to fight for a draw. As the storm clouds continued to gather, they blocked, and blocked, and blocked. Could the Friars salvage a result? The Kobra came on, and despite some (it must be said) slightly overzealous appeals, could make no breakthrough.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What followed was something of a masterstroke from Ek. With three overs to go, he turned to the Village&rsquo;s partnership breaker par excellence &ndash; MMJ. Tanous tried to restrain himself, he really did &ndash; but when a ball is tossed up towards you at a speed no greater than five miles per hour, it&rsquo;s rather hard not to try and give it a spank. And then be caught.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So, nine wickets down, 2 overs to go &ndash; could Page and last man Wakley survive 12 balls? The short answer is no. The slightly longer answer is that Page was LBW to one that bruised his arm, which even by Wiltshire standards is a dismissal that takes some fathoming. It wasn&rsquo;t the first slightly questionable decision, it won&rsquo;t probably won&rsquo;t be the last, and long may it continue.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Anyway, a great performance by the Village against a Friars team somewhat light on batting was followed up by an even better BBQ and a lot of booze at the splendid Bell on the Common. And would you believe it, the rain held off. It all culminated in AB attempting to moon the team and falling over. Always trust the man from Points West.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">MoM &ndash; Lukas Becker. Quick runs at the end, decent spell in the middle. Though very few Villagers put a foot wrong.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Idiot &ndash; While there&rsquo;s always the temptation to point the finger at the umpires and AB&rsquo;s paddy at Stevo was a good &lsquo;un, none of them were playing for the Village. So MK Don for his SK Warne/English Test Player in Pakistan circa 1985 style appeal to a geriatric umpire.</p>
