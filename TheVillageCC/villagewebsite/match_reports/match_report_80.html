<font size="2">The anatomy of a collapse is not one beast: sometimes a change in conditions, sometimes tensions in the team, other times a genius spell. Seldom is it down to norks. But<font color="#000000"><font face="arial"> </font></font></font><font size="2" face="arial" color="#000000">27 July 2008 saw just that. When the Village CC went out to bat against Keevil, the manorhouse ground saw the first nork-related collapse in cricket history.</font><font size="2"><br />
<br />
Nursing apocalyptic hangovers from the previous nights exertions in Broughton Gifford, the Villagers quietly climbed onto the special bus. There was hope in sight. Brimming with memories of the Long's Arms' barmaids, even Shoe who had spent the previous night sleeping in a toilet, knew this sight for sore eyes would prove restorative. But no. Rather than lapping up Butcombe and eyeing up the unfeasibly proportioned barmaids, the village had been robbed. A man stood behind the bar. Though he was later joined&nbsp; by a bar maid, her ample proportions did not match the</font><font size="2"> buxom </font><font size="2"> pulchritude of previous years. With morale sapped and heads low, Village rather reticently made their way to Keevil.<br />
<br />
Electing to bowl, Keevil made the most of swing-friendly conditions knocking over Marcus before weeding out Fudge, who after series of sumptuous on drives, sent a leading edge high to cover. Page strode out at three, only to walk on a goldie, extra bounce from the Duck Pond end saw him faintly glove behind. The collapse continued and despite some fight from Bomb and TJ, who bucolically took to their rustic spinner, the Village were in trouble. More batsmen came and went, and Andy's cameo with the tail saw him holing out to one that swang away. Quicker than you could say 'no Andy, it's a portmanteau word and not an error', the Village were bowled out for 114. But then the tide turned.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Let down by norks, beseiged by DTs, and all out for little over a ton, the Village needed pull something big from the larder. And, boy, did it happen. Tea was served, and, my, was it a spread. With cheese, pates, baguettes and the like, a vast buffet lay before us. The pickles were fiery. The salad was splendid. But that was just that. There was something still to come. And this topped the cornucopia. Moving on to the sweet course, the Village found their fillip. I speak not of scones, nor of sponges, but instead of the fairy cakes. What fairy cakes they were, the very faeriest of cakes. These delicate morsels of airy sponge were roofed with chocolate buttons and clothed with a fine butter icing. But those are just words. </font><font size="2">What a piece of work were these cakes! So noble on tastebuds! How infinite in texture! In form and icing so express and admirable! In flavour how like an angel! In mastication how like a god! The beauty of the world! The paragon of all nibbles! And more, to me, the very quintessence of cake.<br />
<br />
Inspired by the tea and with fairy cakes in their bellies, the Village took to the field with vigour and fight. Saul picked of their opener for a diamond, bowling an absolute peach, whilst Craig at the other end was literally firing down jaffas. With these two pulling pearlers from the bag, Keevil were quickly four-down. The scnce was set for Andy, who in his final spell for the Village, produced a genuinely scary display of awesome fast bowling. With wickets continuing to fall as Potty conjured two inspiring catches, the latter a reflex dive at silly point was probably the best catch in Village history (and this in a position that Parp! has made his own), the game was not over. With Plimmer standing up there was always the sniff of a stumping, and the rubber was live to the very end. <br />
<br />
Keevil's nerve held and they edged it by three wickets. The Village formed a guard of honour to salute Andy as he left the field and departed for Sheffield. The troops retired to pub and curry and the special bus went back home for one more year.  The end. </font><font size="2"> </font>
