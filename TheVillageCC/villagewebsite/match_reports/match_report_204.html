mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi">But I didn&rsquo;t get where I am today by waffling, so on to the match report for this seasons game against Agricola CC at Parliament Hill, North London.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a classically educated, Oxbridge graduate (Brooks College, Oxford), the first thing I would like to observe is that there seems to be a degree of inconsistency amongst the Agricola players &ndash; who are a very friendly bunch &ndash; about the pronunciation of their team&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; This seems to be down to more than the slight Suth Effrican lilt that one or two of them possess: half cheer &ldquo;come on </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(245, 245, 255); background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; ">ah-GRIK-uh-luh&rdquo;, the correct pronunciation of Roman general Gnaeus Julius Agricola&rsquo;s </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(245, 245, 255); background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; ">cognomen</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(245, 245, 255); background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; ">, while half shout &ldquo;good stuff an-gri-KOLA&rdquo; which I assume to be either a little known but aggression inducing product of the Coca-Cola Company or something to do with the clubs early history, as a Ministry for Agriculture works team. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(245, 245, 255); background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; ">Anyway Agricola, however it is pronounced, won the toss on a very green wicket with a Lords-like slope and elected to field.&nbsp; The steel-grey sky promised rain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi">I didn&rsquo;t get where I am today without knowing a real winner when I see one, and I was delighted to see Bomb-prot&eacute;g&eacute;e Matthew Boa stride out to open the batting. Boa is a bowling all-rounder, with a control of line-and-length that is almost as good as my own, and a delightful short-but-curved run which would have been perfect for the backyard Test matches I played as a boy.&nbsp; As a batsmen, he is solid with a short back lift that enables resolute defense and Bombesque fast hands that enable him to send the ball crashing home when he so chooses! <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi">Aided by some fielding errors by the MAFF-men, Boa hit a career best 45, including four fours and two sixes &ndash; one a gorgeous leg glance which carried the boundary on the full and landed near the Village WAGs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi">Other than he and Nick Troja, all the Village batmen struggled and failed against some accurate Agricola bowling on a very slow wicket which offered some inconsistent bounce.&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi">Batting at number 6, Troja hit a tidy 51, playing the ball very late so as to be able to adjust to the above mentioned problematic bounce.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was well supported by Craig Woodhouse during a late 5-over partnership for the 9<sup>th</sup> wicket.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi">I didn&rsquo;t get where I am today without recognising a good score and our total of 156 all out from 39.1 overs was probably 20 short of that, but with a strong bowling attack and a wicket that would assist we remained confident.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi">There was a slight drizzle and live music coming from the Parliament Hill Bandstand by the time we took the field.&nbsp; Due to space constraints and a need to respond urgently to some Mav-baits on VCC Chat, I will not detail my considered thoughts on the Salsa band here.&nbsp; Should you be interested please visit my stream-of-consciousness Twitter feed where I very regularly expurgate my sophisticated opinions on Music, Politics and Johann Hari.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi">After losing a couple of early wickets, Agricola put together a strong partnership for the 3<sup>rd</sup> wicket reaching 60-2 prior to the introduction our hero Boa one over before drinks.&nbsp; Boa stuck immediately, drawing aggressive number 4 Lillo into a mistimed drive to Kris Bird at mid-off.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi">The Boa Constrictor then went onto a roll, keeping things very tight and grabbing wickets seemingly at will.&nbsp; In an 8 over spell, he picked up 6 wickets for only 14 runs: another career best, Boa&rsquo;s second of the day.&nbsp; A team member observed afterwards that while Boa had enjoyed some luck during his innings, the bowling figures were fully deserved.&nbsp; A highlight for me was a sharp caught and bowled, diving away to his right.&nbsp; It was a catch that I would have been proud of!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;

mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi">I didn&rsquo;t get where I am today without knowing a slight wobble when I see one, and this was a big one from Agricola: they lost 7 wickets for 30 runs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi">Neither did I get where I am today without recognising a rib-tickling play on words when I hear one, and the least said about M&rsquo;Harty&rsquo;s shout from midwicket that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s raining but the runs seem to have stopped&rdquo; midway through Matthew Boa&rsquo;s spell the better.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi">Adam Collins finished things off with a fiery couple of overs at the Agricola tail which were interestingly about 20% quicker than his early spell against the opening bats.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s clearly been talking to Paul Bowman.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;

mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi">Agricola were bowled out for 122 in 34.2 overs.&nbsp; We retired to The Bull &amp; Last to discuss WAGs and watch a local jock make a complete mess of an internet date.&nbsp; Spies report that at the end of the evening he leaned in for a kiss and received a hand shake.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
