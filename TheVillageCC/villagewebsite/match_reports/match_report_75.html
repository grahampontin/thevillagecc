<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Two weeks ago, The Village CC were outplayed, outthought and outfought by London Fields, eventually losing by 200 runs after being skittled out for less than 50. But The Village, now in its fifth full season, is nothing if not resilient. In the rematch at Albert Rec, they emerged victorious for only the second time in the league this year, inflicting Fields&rsquo; first defeat in the process.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p></o:p>With skipper KP still out with an ankle injury, it was left to Alan White to once again lead his troops into battle. The nature of the Albert Rec pitch led to much discussion about whether to bat first or second, all of which was rendered redundant when the inevitable happened: Fields called correctly and opted to take first strike.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p></o:p>Fortunately for White, he had a few fresh tricks up his sleeve. Newlywed Pete Lyneham opened the bowling and soon had the Fields batsman in all sorts of trouble. He removed opener Arthur for a duck, the batsman unwisely shouldering arms to one that pitched well outside off-stump, and thought he&rsquo;d seen off keeper-batsman Paul &ndash; a fervent appeal for a catch at slip was turned down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p></o:p>Fields&rsquo; second wicket pair looked on course to build a solid platform for the innings, only for Paul to commit the cardinal sin and run out his own skipper. The dismissal epitomised The Village&rsquo;s work in the field &ndash; Pontin&rsquo;s pick up and throw were sharp and accurate and Plimmer&rsquo;s work behind the stumps exemplary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p></o:p>The Village continued to take wickets at regular intervals, with Eklavya Gupte bowling beautifully on a turning wicket and Andy Richardson putting in perhaps his finest spell in an illustrious Village career. The first of his two wickets came with a classic one-two combination: first, hitting the batsman on the head with a viciously rising delivery; then, following it up with a full, fast yorker. His second wicket was, if anything, even better, a superb delivery swinging past the batsman&rsquo;s defenses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p></o:p>Matters were also helped by another run out. Once again Paul, who top scored with 36, was involved, this time in a monumental mix-up that left both batsman at the striker&rsquo;s end and Dave Ireland with time to walk up to the stumps and flick the bails off. Thinking he had less time than he did, however, <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ireland</st1:place></st1:country-region> aimed at thunderous throw at the stumps from fully three yards. Fortunately, he hit &ndash; otherwise it would have been 4 overthrows and Dave would most likely have gone home in an ambulance, courtesy of a beating from Bomb.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p></o:p>Bravely choosing not to bring back his opening bowlers in a final push for wickets, Alan was rewarded when part-time spinner Marcus removed the final two Fields batsman with some shortcrust hot and tasty snacks. Fields were all out for 161, having failed to see off their allotted 36 overs, and The Village had the scent of victory in their nostrils.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p></o:p>It did not take long before that sweet smell began to make us all nauseous, however. Erstwhile opener Pontin was soon back in the hutch, caught close to the wicket for a duck (although he insists, and will continue to insist to his dying day, that it was a bump ball). Fresh opener Sam did not seem unduly perturbed by the loss of his partner, however, hitting a few sparkling shots in an innings which really got The Village&rsquo;s reply moving.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p></o:p>He departed with the score at 44, and he was soon followed by Thomas, who had seemed incapable of getting the ball off the square, making just 2 in over 13 overs, an innings which would make even Chris Tavare blush. Fortunately, Marcus was next in and, together with Bomb, picked up the pace somewhat thanks to some sharp running between the wickets. Getting to drinks three down, The Village knew they were in with a shout. Sadly, Marcus soon departed and he was followed by Bomb, as Plimmer became the second man in the match to run out his captain. Despite vowing to make amends for his error, Plims soon departed for one and the assembled throng began to fear the worst. 70 were still needed off the last 10 overs, with just four wickets in hand. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p></o:p>&ldquo;Cometh the hour, cometh the man.&rdquo; Or, in this case, men, for The Village were seen home by a partnership full of guts and skill forged between The Example and Andy. Well-placed drives for sharply-taken singles were mixed with lusty blows for four, as the total began to creep ever closer to the magic 162. There was drama aplenty &ndash; <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Richardson</st1:place></st1:city> was dropped at long off, while EG was caught off a no-ball &ndash; but, with two overs left, The Village required just 17. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p></o:p>Seasoned Village watchers knew we were still more than capable of ballsing it up from there. Eklavya had other ideas. He needed just the six balls bowled by Travis to finish the job and one shot in particular, for six towards the wildly celebrating hordes, will live long in the memory. For the second time this season, Gupte had guided The Village home, and this time he got to hit the winning runs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p></o:p>As the eleven warriors drank deep from the keg of victory, there was time to reminisce on a fine game of cricket. Despite a few tight calls and the occasional heat-of-the-moment exchange, the match overall was played in an excellent spirit, with excitement bubbling throughout. Fields showed why they are top of the league &ndash; batting all the way down and utilising a grand total of nine bowlers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p></o:p>For The Village, the Man of the Match is shared between two men, the two who walked off the pitch with bats raised having seen their side home. Eklavya was, as his nickname suggests, exemplary, bowling well in conditions that suited him and batting with poise and assurance. Andy bowled fantastically, reminding us all of what we will miss when he departs Up North, and put his recent batting woes behind him to play a truly vital innings. Sirs, The Village salutes you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p></o:p>After such a day, there should be no recriminations, and so no Village Idiot award will be made this time round. Needless to say, it would have been David had he arsed up that run out, but he didn&rsquo;t, so we can let him off. Just. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
