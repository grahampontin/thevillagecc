<div class=report_title>Match Report</div>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Half way through May and at last the Village were able to get their league campaign under way. The signs weren't looking that promising, 2 defeats on the opening weekend had&nbsp;lessened the Villagers' pre-season swagger. True to form, half the team was late, the only departure from the norm in that regard being Mav who for once was in attendance in time to see the first ball of innings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">P-Ly was the man given the task of getting the league charge off to a good start. Two deliveries later we knew this was no batting surface - both balls were quick, both banged in, neither bounced. It was going to be a day for pea-rollers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">For a time the Juniors&nbsp;looked worth their reputation as a side that had beaten London Fields in their last encounter - a straight six off P-Ly in the 3rd over showed their aggressive intent but this was not a track for aggressive shot-making. The first chance, when it inevitably came, was a steepler, and,&nbsp;perhaps just as inevitably, it was shelled. By Luca. Not an easy chance, they never are dropping out of the sky, but at that point it felt like one we could have done with holding on to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Like all good Village matches it seemed the only way of getting wickets was to hit the stumps and P-Ly duly obliged. Another wild flash from the batsman was met this time with the rattle of bails and off-stump. 12-1: Advantage&nbsp;Village. With a new batsman at crease Lyno brought the field up and was almost instantly rewarded as a thick edge went down in the gully; a&nbsp;diving Gupte unable to hang on to a difficult chance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Meanwhile, at the other end, KP was plying a good line and length with little reward. He did have the nurdler to bowl to, the play-and-miss seemingly his stroke of choice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">From this point your author's memories are a little vague. Perhaps the heat, perhaps old age, perhaps the speed with which the wickets fell. The second of which went to P-Ly again, this time sharp chance was held by the Perp in the position he is rapidly making his own: Cover. Two catches in two weeks for Parp will please his Fantasy backers, and clearly Prep himself, whose celebration fell only just short of MMJ's legendary utterance: &quot;That's it! I've got it! There it is!&quot;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The openers having bowled through it was time for a change, Maj coming on to replace P-Ly from the Portaloo End and DI taking 1st change at the train track end. It was DI who caused batmen the most trouble, a pair&nbsp;of cheap wickets courtesy of some horrible pea-rollers were barely celebrated, such was the ridiculousness of them. Maj, at the other end was&nbsp;steaming in for little reward, not least on account&nbsp;of a pair of highly dubious umpiring decisions, one LBW and one run out, both of which should have been given. Magic's mood was not improved to hear the umpire chuckling to his mate&nbsp;about how he'd&nbsp;not&nbsp;given them out. Poor show.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">It was time for the spinners to come out. Well, ok, spinner, but he does turn it both ways, The Example taking over from Maj. One glimmer of hope for the batting side in the form of a slog over the leg side for 4 and it was Eklavya's turn to join the ranks of Village wicket taker's. Two balls later an off-break gripped and this time it was the leg stump left to stop it in its tracks. He didn't have to wait long for his second either, excellent variation of pace suckering the batsman into a&nbsp;mistimed chip into the leg side. MMJ, keen to make amends for his earlier drop threw himself to his right and amongst a melee of arms and legs came away with the ball in his grasp. 6 down for about 60 and the Juniors were tottering.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">While all this was going on there was just enough time for DI to pick up his third, a wild slog this time resulting in the ball heading straight up the air. Pontin circled underneath and clung on, albeit not too convincingly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Maj, meanwhile had switched ends to replace DI at the end of his spell, hoping for some better luck, and so it was. Another line ball outside off stump, another nibble, and this time the edge - Pontin taking his second catch of day. One wicket was nothing like just reward for an excellent spell.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">By this time the score had moved on to 85 and the Village were in need of tidying things up quickly. Cue the arrival of A-Rich. Four deliveries,&nbsp;one wide and two wickets later it was all over. The&nbsp;Juniors were dismissed for 86 leaving the Village a very chaseable looking 87 to win. But this was no batting track.&nbsp;And this<em><span style="FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"> is</span></em> the Village.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">---<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">It all started so well.&nbsp;&nbsp;KP declared that this was no day for shenanigans and he wanted a ten wicket victory. It was only 87 after all. Pontin and Hom-Ass strode out to the middle in confident mood, knowing that a steady start should be enough to set the team on its way to victory. Shouts of &ldquo;get forward!&rdquo; and &ldquo;vigilance!&rdquo; followed them as they each took their first guards of the season.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The first couple of overs were uneventful. Pontin and Thomas getting a feel for the bowling attack of a new team. The first of the action came in the third over as Pontin tried to break the shackles with an I&rsquo;ll advised drive outside off stump. A huge appeal for caught behind was turned down, neither batsman or umpire in the least convinced that any contact had been made.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Another over and a couple of singles later it was at last time for the Village to get their innings moving, Pontin crashing a somewhat toed but remarkably effective drive through the offside for four. Boundaries followed in the next few overs, Pontin twice chancing an arm on the back foot and whipping the ball away over mid wicket. The fact that mid-wicket ducked on one occasion where standing still would have involved a ball-in-the-face moment will be overlooked. At the other end Hom-Ass was playing the more measured innings, a flick here, a neat lay off there. 10 runs up, 20, 30 it was all looking rather too easy for the Village.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Cue the inevitable collapse. Pontin (20) began the rot as he took one more chance on the back foot and was finally gifted the pea-roller that was coming his way, a guttural cry of dismay heard shortly before the ratting of timbers. Thomas followed in the next over, looking to work another run into the leg side, and chipping the ball to square leg. Square leg juggled, he fell, he grasped... and he dismissed Thomas for a highly commendable 9 given the circumstances. 35-0 had become 36-2 and reality was dawning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">&ldquo;Plenty of batting to come&rdquo; those on the sidelines told themselves. MMJ was next to crease. In this sort of situation he could have the game wrapped up in 2 overs, if only he could survive 2 overs. Survive he did not. He went big early, and not big enough, caught comfortably at mid-on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Bomb, at the other end, was looking far more circumspect, looking once again to anchor a village innings home. Next up: KP. Another big shot, another mis-hit, another wicket, this time mid-off the benefactor. Four down for not many more that forty and this really wasn&rsquo;t looking too clever.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">A-Rich, after an explosive spell with the ball, looked in less than explosive mood with the bat. He and Bomb ground out runs, slowly, carefully, but that was the order of the day. Given one opportunity to free his arm McClarence took advantage to smash a solitary boundary before a nasty bouncer (yes, one that bounced) had him fending off his nose to short(ish) leg for 5.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Bring to the crease Prep. Buoyed by his catch in the first innings he showed a determinedness and stickability that has been lacking from the Village lower order in times gone by.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Make no mistake, this wasn&rsquo;t cricket for the purist, it wasn&rsquo;t elegant, but runs were coming. Extras, edges, any way would do at this point. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">At last, some runs were served up, not by the batsmen, but by a wayward over that cost 11 in extras. In the context of a game in which neither team muscled up a ton it was huge. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">For all it&rsquo;s grittieness, the partnership had to end. Prep the first to go, looking to attack, then Bomb, like Pontin not so long before looking to take advantage on the back foot and undone by another sub-terrainean special.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The collapse was complete. From 35-0 to 70-7: a fine effort, even by Village standards.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Still. All was not lost. The Example and P-Ly were at the crease. P-Ly even had his fianc&eacute; to impress, surely there would be runs in this. With only DI and Maj left in the bag there as a feeling there had to be.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Eklavya, brought up on bounceless sub-continental wickets, took to the challenge like a duck to water, working runs through off and leg sides. Could the Village breathe at last? Could they fuck. P-Ly had clearly decided quickly was the way to win, a massive mow across the line his shot of choice, bowled his mode of dismissal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">7 to win, DI at the cease and only Magic &ldquo;Six and Out&rdquo; left in the hutch. It was, in the words of one of the great winners of all time &ldquo;squeaky bum time&rdquo;. Maj, in a great show of bravado, picked the satellite dish he was going to hit for his winning six. The spectators were not convinced.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">A nudge here, a poke there and it was 3 to win. Just 3 tiny runs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">A more incongruous mode of victory you could not conceive, DI choosing this moment to unfurl one of the most elegant straight drives you will ever see. All timing, all along the floor and all the way to the boundary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">And so it was. The Village CC 88-8 started another league campaign with a win. The words on everyone lips? Can they sustain it this time?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">GCP, 14 May 2008<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Man of the Match:</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"> A tough one. A mention to myself for top scoring with the bat and 2 catches, a mention to A-Rich for polishing off the tail and some determined batting and The Example for an excellent all-round performance. But this wasn&rsquo;t really a day for good cricket, it was a day for saving runs, taking catches and battling hard with the bat. One man did all those things: This week&rsquo;s MOTM, H-Parp.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Village Idiot:</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"> A few contenders here: Several Villagers, that twat on the mini-motorbike, but none so outstanding as the fool that prepared the wicket. This week&rsquo;s Village Idiot: The Groundsman.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
