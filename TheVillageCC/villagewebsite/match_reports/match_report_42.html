<p>The day dawned bright and clear.&nbsp;A short shower in the morning did nothing to dampen Village spirits as the would be Fields killers prepared for what was sure to be a titanic battle.</p>
<p>The nominated start time drew near, the heavens darkened as if in expectation of what was to come, thunder rumbled a drum roll of anticipation and lightening was seen etching the words &quot;victus honor&quot; on its murky canvas.</p>
<p>And then the rains came. </p>
<p>The roads flooded, the people ran for cover and the Fielders celebrated another successful appeal to the rain gods for salvation. Battered but not broken, a small band of gallant Village-folk made it to&nbsp;London Fields. Captain Pontin sallied forth with his counterpart to make&nbsp;a pitch inspection, but it was too late. What had, only a few minutes before, been a wicket, was now more suitable for longboats than gladiators and once again the Fields had escaped.</p>
<p>As you might expect, those that braved the rains to make it to London Fields adjourned first to the Pub on the Park and later the Pembury Tavern for refreshments and jovial banter.</p>
<p>For the record the Village now lead the series 1-0. That's runs, not matches.</p>
