<conditions><p>Fair</p> </conditions><p>The rainclouds which had been hanging over Britain for weeks finally broke for long enough to allow for a game of cricket as the Village left London for their first tour of 2012.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The destination: Cambridge. The opposition: Wolfson College. And the ground? Not Barton Road, but a similarly picturesque college facility just down the road where the pitch appeared to have been left uncovered for the preceeding month of wet weather.</p>
<p>As a result, scoring was tough as Wolfson chose to bat after the winning the toss. An explosive first over from opening batsman Cameron was soon brought to a close as Becker came on at the other end, while fellow opener James was run out as the Village took early control and the runs dried up. Wickets fell at regular intervals but a dogged unbeaten 47 from number six batsman Stubbs gave the hosts (135/8) something to bowl at.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Wolfson, they also had to bowl at Village newcomer Glen Moroney. Once Will Hayles had departed for three, the fresh-off-the-plane Australian defied jetlag, chilly English conditions and a claim not to have played cricket for a while as he unleashed some destructive batting on the oppo. He was ably assisted at the other end by Alan White, who fell seven short of a half century with the finishing line in sight.</p>
<p>No matter. Captain Gupte strode out to the crease but was not needed - Moroney finished the job himself, ending on an impressive 75 not out. (He'd also taken a catch while in the field. Just wait for the Village effect to kick in.)</p>
<p>And so a month after Village recorded a stylish win over Pimlico Strollers in their first and only match of the season, the 100% record was maintained and it was off to Efes, via the Rad, for a kebab feast. Rumour has it England celebrate Test victories in very much the same fashion, and if it's good enough for them, it's good enough for us.</p>
