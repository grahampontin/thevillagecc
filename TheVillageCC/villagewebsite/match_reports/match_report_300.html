mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:#222222">The touring party was split into two travelling groups with one departing Gatwick at the ungodly hour of 6.25 a.m. on Friday 24<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;April and the other leaving from &ldquo;London&rdquo; Luton later that evening. Chaotic scenes greeted the vanguard upon arrival at Gatwick however, with the luggage sorting system not working and all checked bags were simply left with a man who claimed to be in charge of bags for the Malta flight. After a smooth 3 hour flight across the continent, EK had acquired some swimming goggles in accordance with tour rules and the Village arrived to find TdM&rsquo;s bag had not made it&nbsp;L. Form filling complete and with an offer from the Sun news desk to be interviewed on &lsquo;how this was going to ruin our holiday&rsquo;, the Village arrived at the Blue Sea St. George Park &amp; La Vallette Resort in Paceville c.11am to find check-in closed. So with bags securely deposited and the touring party headed out to commence battle with the Maltese Friday afternoon drinking crowd and soon came across the beautifully presented &ldquo;<a href="http://www.thebeergardenmalta.com/"><span style="color:#1155CC">Sun in Splendour</span></a>&rdquo; boasting Malta&rsquo;s finest beer garden. JdM ably took command of the club kitty and ordered &ldquo;9 Cisk [pr. Chisk] please barkeep&rdquo;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:#222222">Now this was the start of something beautiful. It is fair to say that Cisk become the touring party&rsquo;s 14<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;man for the four days of our stay. 'Cisk Lager' is a golden-coloured, bottom-fermented lager with an alcohol content of 4.2%. Fruit and malt flavours can be noted. The name &quot;Cisk&quot; originates from Giuseppe Scicluna's nickname &quot;Iċ-Ċisk&quot; or in English, &quot;The cheque&quot;. Scicluna was notable for his use of cheques, and due to the unpopularity of the payment method in Malta at that time, some of Scicluna's clients had the habit of referring to him as &quot;Ċisk&quot;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Undeterred, Bosh managed to break down the Wall&rsquo;s defences and begin to negotiate hard for they room keys to which we were entitled. At the same time, most of the rest of the vanguard had made their way to the pool where Morgs looked masculine, an Irish woman got her tit out and EK skewered his hand on a hedge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Calibri;
mso-ascii-theme-font:major-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font:major-latin">The Village awoke, fresh, ready for battle and, after a series of average breakfasts acquired from a variety of sources across the island, hopped on the bus to Marsa sports ground to play the Pretenders CC in a 35 over game.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Calibri;
mso-ascii-theme-font:major-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font:major-latin">The Pretenders won the toss and unsurprisingly batted first on the artificial wicket. An early injury to opening bowler Ben Hampton meant that his partner in crime Nick Thompson was required to keep the pressure on singlehandedly. He was duly rewarded for his efforts however, by dismissing both Pretender openers courtesy of smart towering catches by de Mellow and Cressey. A sharp slip catch from captain Troja saw the back of the Pretenders number 4, Dunn, but this brought together Sanders and Duncan who combined to rebuild the Pretenders&rsquo; innings. Enter EK (a.k.a. Klav, Eklavya, Ekky, Eku, E-K-L-A&hellip;) who, despite only have one operable arm proceeded to snare Duncan LBW before grabbing on to a hard hit return chance to dismiss Sanders. The opposition on the sidelines were simply in awe of the man from Bombay&rsquo;s mystical spin, which saw figures returned of 4-0-14-2.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Calibri;
mso-ascii-theme-font:major-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font:major-latin">The rest of the innings proceeded largely without incident, aside from a marvellous run-out by Bomb, to see the Pretenders finish on a respectable, but gettable 203 from the allotted 35.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Calibri;
mso-ascii-theme-font:major-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font:major-latin">The Village&rsquo;s reply got off to a normal, then good, and then bad start, all in the first over. Opening batsman Cressey played out a dot, nudged 2, cut over point for 4 and then, having taken the first 3 balls of the innings for 6 runs, conspired to miss a straight one to be given out plumb LBW. The Village then began their own rebuilding job in much the same vein as the Pretenders with well-compiled 50s from Oliver Morgans and Stephen Harty, including Morgans&rsquo; first even run on international soil. Despite this the Village struggled to keep up with the required run rate with a large number of fielders back on the ropes cutting off all boundary options. With 2 balls to go, the Village required 11 to win. At this point Bomb decided the honourable thing to do was not to embarrass the Pretenders by smearing both deliveries over the ropes, but instead to calmly block delivery number 34.5 back to the bowler before completing a fine red inker to leave the Village on 194-6.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Calibri;
mso-ascii-theme-font:major-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font:major-latin">Undeterred, the Village set about the Cisk before heading back to the hotel briefly ahead of the evening meal arranged with the Pretenders at l&rsquo;Artiste in Sliema. The meal itself was the hautest of haute cuisine with the lamb in particular going down well and the skipper seeing off his plate of moules in 10 seconds flat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Calibri;
mso-ascii-theme-font:major-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font:major-latin">The rest of the evening unfolded in rather familiar manner with Cisk after Cisk making their lazy way down the Villagers&rsquo; throats in the Times Square bar, the Dubliner and, of course, the Scotsman. Tonight however, the Scotsman session ended decidedly differently to the previous night with the &lsquo;angry Glaswegian&rsquo; girl rubbing Pitcher up the wrong way before herself getting rubbed up the right way by Ollie. Never has a drunken outburst in a pub been more warranted yet unexpected than Pitcher&rsquo;s assertion of &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t shut up in the next 15 seconds&hellip;I&rsquo;m leaving&rdquo;. This was roundly met with a &lsquo;Shut your little cock&rsquo; from Scottish Nicole (this reporter cannot quite remember her name, but I think this is correct) and he had to leave.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Calibri;
mso-ascii-theme-font:major-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font:major-latin">After 1 more Cisk in the &lsquo;waterfall bar&rsquo;, the Village hit the hay with approximately 3 hours until the coach was due to pick us up for our first T20 game.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Calibri;
mso-ascii-theme-font:major-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font:major-latin">As per the previous day Cressey and de Mellow strode out to open the innings possibly still drunk and definitely unable to properly see the ball. The situation was compounded by the two openers forcing each other to run two threes in the first over. Unsurprisingly therefore, wickets soon fell and it was left to Harty and Troja this time to rebuild the innings with some smart running interspersed by the odd boundary. After Harty had departed for 25, captain Troja&rsquo;s impressive and vital innings was brutally ended by a one-handed screamer of a catch at backward point from Malta&rsquo;s answer to Paul Collingwood. His contribution of 39 turned the game in the Village&rsquo;s favour and saw the tourists end on 145 for 9 from the allotted 20 overs. Best figures from the home side came from Liam Azzopardi with 3-24 from 4 overs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Calibri;
mso-ascii-theme-font:major-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font:major-latin">Marsa&rsquo;s reply was dominated by number 3 batsman Nowell, who would have undoubted won the game for the Maltese had the Village not worked incredibly hard with hangovers to starve him of the strike. With 3 overs to go, the game belonged to the Village but when captain played captain, Tony Azzopardi hit Village CC captain, and hero of the first innings, NP Troja for two consecutive sixes to but the game in the balance. Unfortunately for the home team, this wasn&rsquo;t quite enough and when Gupte dismissed Tony for a hard-hit 18, the game was finally won. A superb effort in the field from the Village and a special mention to Chris Pitcher for returning 2-17 from 4 without staging an ultimatum regarding his presence on the field should the batsman fail to shut up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Calibri;
mso-ascii-theme-font:major-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font:major-latin">The Village had taken an early lead in the Malta Crossfire tournament with another fixture to play immediately afterwards to secure the trophy. By this time, the Pretenders had turned up. They were well lubricated from the night before and boy had they had their protein!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Calibri;
mso-ascii-theme-font:major-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font:major-latin">Once again, the Village went into bat first, but this time failed to capitalise on the hangovers of the opposition. New opening partnership Bomb and Bosh got off to a steady start but once they were dismissed (for 9 and 15 respectively) wickets fell with worrying regularity. The innings meekly subsided with Frank topping the scores with 30. The only other double figure scores came from Bosh&rsquo;s 15 and a streaky 12 from Cressey now batting at number 9. 93 all out did not feel enough, but the Village entered the field determined to keep things tight and put pressure on the Pretenders to work their way towards the total.<o:p></o:p></span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Calibri;
mso-ascii-theme-font:major-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font:major-latin">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Calibri;
mso-ascii-theme-font:major-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font:major-latin">Once again, opening bowler Nick Thompson dismissed both Pretender openers &ndash; this time for a pair of blobs - but this brought Colonel Sanders back to the crease to revisit his heroics form the previous day. Again, together with Duncan, Sanders batted the Village out of the game. Run rate was no problem and neither, did it appear, were wickets. That was until the introduction of Pitcher with the scores tied. With one (not given) wide in the over, Pitch then proceeded to bowl a triple wicket maiden kicked off by a magnificent one-handed, left-handed catch at mid-on by Ollie Morgans. His Tinder date had turned up to watch, but she missed it. We all understand though, taking time out to purchase a Cisk is enough to make any girl miss a bit of cricket, even if it was champagne moment of the Village Tour. Despite Pitcher and Ollie&rsquo;s efforts (he also took another catch in the triple wicket maiden), the Pretenders&rsquo; Duncan knocked off the winning runs comfortably the next over to put the Village in a precarious position with 1 win, and 1 heavy loss. <o:p></o:p></span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Calibri;

mso-ascii-theme-font:major-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font:major-latin">The equation was complicated but Marsa had to beat the Pretenders in the last game for the Village to be in with a chance of the trophy. As it transpired, Marsa did indeed win, but had scored far too many runs for the Village who took a valiant 2<sup>nd</sup> place in a three-way tie.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

We saw a drone, we ate at a bar called Cockney&rsquo;s, Bosh got lost, EK got a bus with the locals and we made it back in time for the bus. One last Cisk at the airport with the Pretenders who shared our flight back to Luton and the Village was done. A successful tour completed, results could have gone better but socially an experience that will won&rsquo;t be forgotten quickly. Cisk &ndash; lest we forget.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
