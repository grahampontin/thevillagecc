<conditions><p>..........</p> </conditions><p>&ldquo;Veni, Vidi, Vici&rdquo;. And about bloody time.</p>
<div style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt">After many botched attemps, from the sublime to the ridiculous (this reporter was involved in a run-out at London Fields three seasons ago that makes Monty Panesars&rsquo; running between the wickets look positively professional), Village finally came away from London Fields with a well deserved win. And what a win it was. The game ebbed and flowed but not until the final over was it clear that the Village would be leaving triumphant.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt">On paper our batting line up looked very strong with the twin powerhouses of Harty and Troja both in the line up, as well as at least 5 others who could easily knock off half centuries. The bowling department didnt look as strong on paper and it was clear from the start that it was an important toss to win and batting first was the logical thing to do. Captain Gupte obliged and we had first use of a nice looking batting wicket.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt">The bowling from the outset was fairly ordinary (except one left arm bowler who was getting the ball to swing into the right-handers), the wicket was very flat, the boundaries were short and the outfield was lightning fast. Of course all these factors in the past would point to Village all out for about 110 and an early finish. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt">However, on this occasion, a very strange thing happened; we actually looked like a decent cricket team. As many Old Villagers will know all too well, the very act of walking over the boundary line at Fields has had a very strange effect in the past &ndash; that of making otherwise stalwart Villagers resemble Laurel and Hardy trying their hand at cricket for the first time. This time around, it was Fields who looked like Stan and Olly, with some pretty woeful and lazy fielding that cost them about 30 runs and in the end, this was to be the deciding factor. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt">After a useful opening partnership, De Mellow was first to depart contributing 19. In came Morgans, and he, with Harty, proceeded to add the best part of 100 to the total. Harty was particularly brutal to the Fields&rsquo; bowlers, who obliged by serving up some First Rate Pies that were duly despatched in the direction of the either the Lido, the Pub on the Park or the piss-poor funfair that resembled the one in a Father Ted episode. By the time Morgans was out for a sterling 45, Village were sitting pretty at at around the 140 mark, a full 20 overs to go and eight wickets in hand. A score of 300 plus beckoned.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt">At this point, it was very noticable that watching Villagers were <i>not </i>getting carried away with what was happening and certainly <i>not </i>saying things to each other things like &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what all the fuss is about, playing here&rdquo;. There was a palpable feeling that we were in for a <i>cricket</i> match and any feelings of arrogance at this stage would simply put the mockers on proceedings.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt">After a quick 30 by Troja and Harty holing out on the boundary, agonisingly 4 short of a well deserved century, a collapse of sorts occured, with Odlum, new boy Woods and Thompson adding 7 between them. All of a sudden the 300+ score looked out of reach and even 250 looked like it might be too much. However a fine unbroken 8<sup>th</sup> wicket partnership between Will Hayles (25no) and Gupte (23no), propelled the Village score to a decent score of 266 from our 40 overs.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt">So to Fields&rsquo; run chase. A good opening spell from Thompson, aided by Hayles, kept the scoring relatively modest, with Thompson bowling the opener Graham with a beauty of a delivery. Then things turned decidedly in favour of the home team, with Rice and Miller adding around 200 for the second wicket. Rice in particular, was especially brutal with some Village bowling (mine included, although I did somehow manage to just miss all three of his stumps with one of my better balls that turned and bounced).</div>
<div style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt">Rice was dropped fairly early on in his innings (thankfully, for the fielder concerned, I am writing this two weeks after the event and have no recollection who you are) and&nbsp;our score of 266 was being eroded all too quickly. A change of bowling saw Troja pick up the wicket of Miller for 83. Although the rate at this point was managable for Fields, we all knew that the wicket of Rice was absolutely key. This felt like a proper game of cricket with everyone feeling fully involved whether bowling or fielding.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt">So with around 40 needed off 7 overs, Gupte snared the dangerman Rice, (a second catch for Odlum) who left the field with 132 to his name. After this a further three Fields batsman departed for single figure scores, with Gupte taking his wicket tally to three, including a fine stumping by Morgans. So with 18 needed off the final over, The Fat Lady made her appearance and it was time to celebrate what will go down as a memorable victory.</div>
