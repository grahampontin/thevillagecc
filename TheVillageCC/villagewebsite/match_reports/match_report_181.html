<conditions><p>Fine.</p> </conditions><p>I have observed previously that Stephen Harty is essentially a weedy version of Shane Watson.&nbsp; Like &ldquo;Watto&rdquo;, he is an aggressive right-handed brute who doesn't need to follow-through to gain a boundary. Also like his fellow Australian Watson, his drives and pulls are smoothly executed and he latches onto a short balls &ndash; albeit ones delivered at only 50 or 60 mph &ndash; as quickly as Ricky &ldquo;you can trust me on catches, mate&rdquo; Ponting.<br />
<br />
Stephen will have you believe that he is the second best bat at the club behind 2011 debutant and fellow convict Nick Troja.&nbsp; Leaving aside for a moment the less eye-catching, and under used (he is also a useful medium pacer) batting talents of one Alan White (the club&rsquo;s leading run scorer) this apparently modest assertion deserves analysis:<br />
<br />
2011 runs (to 24/7/11): 565 @ 94 (Harty), 382 @ 95 (Troja)<br />
High Score: 138 not out (Harty), 115 not out (Troja)<br />
<br />
So, little in it statistically - given Harty has played one more game - but Stephen has the slight edge.<br />
<br />
They are quite different bats, something which does not aid easy comparison:&nbsp; Troja is offside dominant and yet willing to go over mid on when the bowling requires.&nbsp; Harty naturally favours the leg side, and the back foot, and starts much more quickly (amusingly &ndash; and oddly &ndash; the only man to outscore Harty in a partnership against Crouch End CC was yours truly).&nbsp; Nick, who seems defensively strong, would probably be the better of the two at 1, 2 or 3; Harty the better at 4, 5 or a game of baseball.<br />
<br />
Neither have been tested against strong bowling in 2011, at least not in games when your writer was present.&nbsp; This may be remedied later in the season when Village face a surgically enhanced St Annes All Stars XI.&nbsp; Nevertheless, we have seen Harty perform well against strong bowling in previous seasons (for example when he played for the BBC against VCC in 2010) and therefore must give him the edge in this respect also.<br />
<br />
Therefore: stop being so damned self-effacing Stephen.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t buy your assertion that Nick is the better bat, and I very much doubt I am the only one.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
None of this will be of much interest or consolation to the Crouch End bowlers, who &ndash; after a careful Harty start - were bludgeoned for a club record 138 not out from (if memory serves) 101 balls.&nbsp; Six-obsessed Ben Hampton will be interested to note that the innings included 8 sixes.<br />
<br />
The innings was paced well, Stephen perhaps conscious of a very slightly longer than usual tail, with the bulk of the runs coming in the last 10 overs of the innings.<br />
Strong support was provided by the technically correct but hard hitting Lucas Becker who made 39 not out at number 6.<br />
<br />
Nick Troja was out LBW for 20 something.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t see it, but apparently it was plumb. &ldquo;Plumber than Mr Plum the plumber eating a plum pudding&rdquo;.&nbsp; Your writer hit a score of 20 something too: the only shot of note was an inside-out aerial coverdrive which the (unseen) fielder at deep cover generously decided he didn&rsquo;t fancy and allowed to bounce.<br />
VCC posted 252-4 from their 40 overs, a score which we realised to be a winning total within 2 or 3 overs of the Crouch End innings.&nbsp; Crouch End had a couple of rabbits in their top five and Matty Boa quickly removed these with full straight balls.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Assisted by some very honest umpiring (three LBWs were given), we barely saw an orthodox cricket shot until Crouch End were 8 down, when an Indian gentlemen who looked a little like Tyrion Lannister came in and dispatched the Village attack for a series of pleasant looking boundaries.<br />
<br />
It was too little, much too late however, Crouch End managed to push the total up past 100 before an excellent Nick Troja run out finished them off.<br />
<br />
We retired to a local pub to speculate on various far-fetched scenarios under which Alan White might secure the captaincy.<br />
<br />
Man-of-the-Match: Stephen Harty &ndash; 138 not out<br />
Village Idiot: Stephen Harty &ndash; repeated excessive modesty<br />
