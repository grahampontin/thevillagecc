<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:-7.1pt"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">The Villagers arrived at the ground sweating like watermelons out of a freezer. The players&rsquo; commitment still at optimum levels with net sessions and long fielding drills.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:-7.1pt"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">The HAC won the toss and decided to bat first on an excellent batting wicket and lighting fast carpet&rsquo;esque&rsquo; outfield. Their openers Ramjag and Edwards started on a slow but steady note, attributable to great line and length swing and seam bowling from Village bowlers Bossy and Ben from either end, but without any wickets to show for. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:-7.1pt"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">The Village got their first breakthrough with the introduction of season&rsquo;s bowler EK, who accounted for Edwards glancing him onto onside but ending with a top notch slip catch by Troj. All that pre-game unrelenting brutal practice by Bosh given to his skip had paid off. EK soon got another breakthrough when JdM held a fantastic catch off number 3 Casey, who in true appreciable spirit walked off having nicked. All that practice by JdM had shown results. Ramjag however was batting comfortably by now. He was joined by Parry and the two of them together took the HAC to drinks at 82 for 2 after 20 overs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:-7.1pt"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">After the drinks, the two batsmen started playing some beautiful shots and accelerating. With the ball getting old and not doing much, scoring on this track became very easy. Troj finally got the better of Ramjag who was bowled for 84. Parry played some clever shots all round the wicket and the Villagers were staring at a big total. Becker bowled a useful spell and put the brakes on to a certain extent. The re-introduction of Ben and Bossy coming into the attack and bowling well curtailed the scoring to a large extent. The highlight of this period being the stumping of Parry by some brilliant glovework by JdM off the bowling of Ben. Good thinking by JdM to be standing up to such fiery pace. And yes, it was a stumping!! Ben had the first one of his career!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:-7.1pt"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">The Villagers were set 252 to win and with a batting line up extending to number 11, this team was confident they could chase any target. Special thanks to HAC for being fantastic hosts and arranging a wonderful tea for everyone. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:-7.1pt"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">The Village openers JdM and WLD got into rhythm of the chase extremely quickly and effortlessly against HAC&rsquo;s new found pace sensation Pitcher and other bowlers, rotating the strike with ease and punishing anything slightly lose. After ten overs, Village were 66 for 1 for the loss of JdM and well on track with a solid platform. JdM played his typical shots with aplomb and WLD clocked back the years and was &lsquo;brutal elegance&rsquo; personified. With his intimidating, confident tall frame and quick hands, WLD was making opportunities than waiting for any to be presented, finding gaps with ease and playing some incredible shots 360 degrees including reverse sweeps and in the process also notching 17 off one over and a couple of boundaries each in a few others. He was denting the chase and the fielding confidence. Abrar provided some stodgy able support. WLD finally got out at the boundary for 68, picking the lone man with a shot that would have been six two metres either side. Analysts and experts reckon if it wasn&rsquo;t the heat and tiredness leading to declined runs, WLD could have ended up 80 odd. WLD had played the best innings in a long time at better than a run a ball.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:-7.1pt"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">Captain &ldquo;Slogger&rdquo; Troj then joined Abrar and injected urgency in running between the wickets and carried the momentum forward with quickfire runs and running the fielders ragged and his partners, as always, begging for mercy. Abrar departed and Troj was joined by TdM. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:-7.1pt"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">Troj played some classy shots to get to 29 and in the process getting to the well deserved milestone of 500 runs for the season. With a fair few games to go, others have a lot of catching up to do and Troj can hopefully overhaul season tally for the club runs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:-7.1pt"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">With Troj gone and still a lot of work to be done, TdM took up the mantle along with Bossy (21*) to complete the chase. After initially measuring the bowlers for a few balls, TdM cut loose to have the HAC and Village witness one of the best knocks under pressure. He only justified his immense talent in making batting look easy and raced to 48 in a matter of couple of overs. Perhaps, he wasn&rsquo;t told he had more time and didn&rsquo;t need to be that devastating. He was ably supported by Bossy, who had just woken up after a long sleep behind the scoreboard and reached the crease with his eyes still half closed. Just goes to show what Villagers could achieve half asleep. With one run to get, TdM got bowled playing a sweep shot. The formalities were completed by Sam, who had toiled hard in the field to save a few runs even with a dodgy knee. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:-7.1pt"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">This was a remarkable win and that the chase was completed in 36 overs bears testament to how well everyone contributed &ndash; first with the energy on the field and then with the bat. In particular, this will long be remembered for how WLD rediscovered himself and how TdM had just done a mere job of being himself with the bat. Only Dewan had any respectability in his figures and he did bowl brilliantly. A hot day had just seen some of the hottest performances. Befittingly, Village ended up winning their 200<sup>th</sup> game at a very special ground to provide everlasting memories.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:-7.1pt"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">The day ended with Villagers enjoying a few celebratory drinks, chats covering anything and everything, runs in all directions, sandwiches, curries, kebabs and what not. The focus now shifts onto the remaining games and sustaining the same confidence and belief.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
