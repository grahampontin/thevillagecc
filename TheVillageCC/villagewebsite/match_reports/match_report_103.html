<p><u><strong>BADGER CULLING - THE REPORT</strong></u></p>
<p>Some men are touched by greatness. They &quot;come to the party&quot;, as the 2005 Ashes-winning side might have put it, at just the right time. They make match-winning contributions at precisely the moments when the game looks to be slipping away. But rarely do they do it with bat, ball and fielding prowess all in the same Titanic struggle. And when they do, it needs to be celebrated. Step forward, Marcus Littlejohns.</p>
<p><strong>CLASSIC</strong><br />
The annual match against Rampant Badgers is quickly developing classic status. After last year's final-over heroics from Paul Bowman secured a dramatic tie in a rain-hit encounter, the Village emerged triumphant this time around by what seemed like the narrowest of margins. In the end it was 10 runs, but it felt mighty close.</p>
<p>Marcus (still preposterously listed as 'mate of Bomb' despite being vice-captain) gave a hint of what was to come when amassing 24 with the bat to help the Village to a decent total on a tricky pitch. KP's breezy 14 as an opener and Olly Morgans' 22 all came in good support of Sabi, who managed 35 despite being unable to run thanks to warts on his feet.</p>
<p><strong>LATE</strong><br />
In the end Sabi was bowled by a particularly hungover David Ireland, one of several Villagers dumped on the oppo. DI was so late to this fixture that when the Badgers' opening bowler returned for a spell at the end of the innings, Ireland remarked: &quot;This guy is good - why hasn't he been bowling before?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>COLLAPSE</strong><br />
The Village suffered something of a batting collapse before Eklavya's mate Lucas, also suffering from a hangover, carted 11 runs in a final wicket stand to take the total beyond 150 before falling to Villager-turned-ringer Maj.</p>
<p>Opinion differed over how much a good total was on another Rec pitch that was offering a fair amount of help to the bowlers, but 157 seemed defendable. Particularly when KP removed iconic Badgers opener Will Scott-Gall for 1.</p>
<p>That brought sometime-Villager Chris Magnifique to the crease, with the all-too-familiar Alan White at the other end. Early Village enthusiasm was quickly extinguished (twas ever thus, according to Bomb) as the two batsmen set about an impressively morale-sapping stand.</p>
<p><strong>TORSO</strong><br />
KP and Danny Lamond struggled to make inroads, so the ball was thrown to Eklavya and your sometime-shirtless correspondent. This too failed to stem the flow of runs until the after the drinks break, when the experience of having sunned his torso in competition with some Aussie-rules players finally provided some inspiration to your correspondent, who duly bowled both Chris Magnifique for 41, and then Press Association bunny Alan White 36. Louse Time indeed.</p>
<p>Game won, surely? But no. Two quick wickets from KP and one from Lucas seemed to have the Village on course, before the Badgers regrouped.</p>
<p>With few runs left to play with, Littlejohns re-entered the fray. Bowling spin as opposed to the medium pace that proved so effective in Cambridge, the vice-captain removed dangerman Townsend for 23, Lotinga for 6 and Mick, returning to the crease for a second innings, for 0.</p>
<p>But the match still wasn't tied up, and the Badgers needed less than 5 an over to secure a memorable victory. In his bid to defeat yet another of the sides he moonlights for, KP reached levels of pump normally only demonstrated by the Louse and Sabi - which is when Marcus put his man-of-the-match award beyond doubt.</p>
<p><strong>JIG</strong><br />
Your correspondent has forgotten who was bowling at the time, but the ball was pushed off the square and the batsmen set off for a run. Marcus swept in, picked up the ball, and threw down the stumps. Alex Hanson, who had kept wicket for both sides, embarked on a truly remarkable arm-swirling jig that will never be forgotten by anyone who saw it.</p>
<p><strong>MODEST</strong><br />
The Village were victorious, and the plaudits went to a man who had put in a superb all-round performance. Fearing he would also put everyone to shame with the quality of his chat in the bar, he slung his bag over his shoulder and strolled off towards the tube - as fine a figure of modesty as ever seen in a sporting arena.</p>
<p><strong>IDIOT</strong><br />
I think man of the match is clear.</p>
<p>Village idiot is a tough one. Bomb made too many runs despite taking no wickets and falling to the Press Association again. So the honour must go to David Ireland, for being so late and so hungover that KP couldn't do enough to offload him to the other team.</p>
