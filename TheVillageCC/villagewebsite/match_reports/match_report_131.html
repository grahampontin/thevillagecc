<conditions><p>Sunny, hard flat pitch. Perfect conditions for smacking sixes and bowling really fast (if you were the oppo).</p> </conditions><p>Some notes to this extraordinary game: we had 15 players but but four of them were only available for an innings each. This was a rag-tag bunch of ringers, Rain Men and others.</p>
<p>Morgans wasn't captain but match report editor won't let me put it in - it was Parp who was left carrying the can.</p>
<p>The Village fielded its first celebrity, folk musician <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Thompson">Teddy Thompson</a> (nope, me neither). </p>
<p>They were actually very good. Of course next week against a far weaker team we suddenly had our best XI available....</p>
