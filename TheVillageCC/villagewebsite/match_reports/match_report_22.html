<br />
It's time for the Vilage to order kit (not Kit Balyntine). For the uninitiated, pictures of a subbiteo cricketer in Village colours may be found at <a href="http://www.thevillagecc.org.uk/gallery3.asp">http://www.thevillagecc.org.uk/gallery3.asp</a>.<br />
<br />
In addition to our existing items, we are branching into leisure wear with a natty polo shirt. This has already been touted as the thinking man's alternative to Hackett </span><span class="q">by none other than Jeff Banks of Clothes Show fame</span><span class="q">. It will be an ideal item for WAGs and camp followers* and may be available in colours such as lilac, pink and baby blue for Morgans. <br />
<br />
[1] </span><span class="q">Polo shirt embroidered with Village CC logo with fixture list printed on reverse = &pound;17</span>.50 (choice of colours please specify size S-XXL)<span class="q"><br />
<br />
</span><span class="q">[2] </span><span class="q">Cotton cricket shirt in cream embroidered with Village CC logo = &pound;20 (available in long sleeve, short sleeve or 3/4 length, available in sizes M-XXL)</span><br />
<span class="q"><br />
[3] Slip-over sleeveless sweater with green and gold trim embroidered with Village CC logo = &pound;35 (Please specify chest size) <br />
<br />
[4] Long-sleeved sweaters with green and gold trim embroidered with Village CC logo = &pound;40 (Please specify you chest size)<br />
<br />
[5] Myrtle &amp; white hooped woolen cap = &pound;25 (please specify your hat size)<br />
<br />
Some prices may be subject to minor alteration depending on 'set up costs' and certain items may be subject to minimum orders. I am looking into the possibility of getting club ties made. More follow. <br />
<br />
Please let me know what you would like WEDNESDAY 25th APRIL so I can finalise the order and so that we'll have kit before our second league game on May 12th.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
