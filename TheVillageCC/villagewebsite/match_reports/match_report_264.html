<conditions><p>&nbsp;Changeable but hot when the sun came out</p> </conditions><p>&nbsp;Hangovers to the left, hangovers to the right, hangovers opening the batting and hangovers opening the bowling. It mattered not that the majority of Saturday&rsquo;s Villagers had spent the previous evening, fuelled by &pound;15 jugs of continental lager, watching the Qantas Socceroos in their futile late-night quest to put the Chilean national side to bed. The Village STREAK is back after a huge 111 run win over Strongroom in the idyllic Highgate Woods.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Batting first on a decent looking pitch, HK and JDM had a look at the opening bowlers before HK decided enough was enough and skied a catch to mid-on to leave him free to check out the sausage rolls on offer at the park caf&eacute; and compile the world&rsquo;s most accurate scorebook. Nevertheless, JDM looked solid and was regularly seen knocking the ball over extra cover with ease as captured on video by square leg umpire N Thompson. Although the Village lost 2 wickets in 2 balls to Binay (including the returning Ben Hampton who got a ripper first up), de Mellow soon joined forces with the free-spirited L Becker, and the two began to take the game away from Strongroom. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By the time JDM departed for a well-constructed 75, the score had progressed to more than 160 and, with 8 overs to go, the Village had their sights set on 220. It was sometime around the 35<sup>th</sup> over when, nerves jangling but mind focused, Becker picked up a length ball and deposited it back over the bowlers head for a magnificent 6 to bring up his maiden 50. Strongroom looked concerned when Becker was dropped next ball following a regulation nick to the keeper, but it didn&rsquo;t prove too costly as a mix up between Bilal and Becker soon resulted in the dashing number 5 returning to the hutch for a crucial 58.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Bilal kept the momentum up however, with a powerful 31 including some lusty leg-side hitting to leave the Village on 229 for 8 from their allocated 40 overs.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Tea was an efficient affair with pre-prepared sandwiches stuffed with a good selection of fillings including a delightful ham and avocado number and rice wrapped in vine-leaves.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Back out on the park, swing merchant M Boa was causing problems for the top order from the top end, whilst an unwashed N Thompson was doing his best to simultaneously ruin his ankle and decide if his previous evening&rsquo;s tryst was really &lsquo;amour&rsquo;. As it turns out, &lsquo;the one&rsquo; for Thompson was opposition captain Will who missed a quick and straight one to be sent back and leave the home team in trouble at 3 down for not very many. Boa&rsquo;s opening spell left him with an impressive 3-17 off 6 but this would not be his final intervention of the day.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The only Strongroom batsman to offer any real resistance from the top order was opener &ldquo;Jon&rdquo; who took the Village bowling for &lsquo;double&rsquo; after &lsquo;double&rsquo; much to the amusement of the fielding side. The opener&rsquo;s spell at the crease was ended by Naz whose middle overs brought him a superb 4-23 from 8 including Binay who was bowled the ball after he had returned a catch to the bowler off a no-ball.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Naz&rsquo;s spell ended in a tale of two catches. Firstly, the safe hands of HK held on to a screamer at gully to send the Village into raptures possibly only rivalled by those exhibited by HK&rsquo;s posh Notting Hill conquest from the night before. Secondly, with the game and a Michelle for Naz on offer, the batsman chipped the ball lightly to cover, Troja at slip yelled &ldquo;that&rsquo;s five&rdquo; and M Boa decided to slowly palm the ball from a comfortable chest height down into the turf. No easier catch has ever been dropped.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The innings ended two overs later as HK&rsquo;s mystery spin failed to beat the defences of Strongroom&rsquo;s 10 and 11 but Bilal was successful in snaffling Riaz for an entertaining 20 courtesy of another good catch at gully by the mystery spinner.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">All in all, an excellent performance from the Village as they look to REBUILD THE STREAK. No game next week due to the &lsquo;international break&rsquo;, but if the hunger and passion burns in the hearts of the players (more likely it was beer-induced heartburn) for the rest of the season like it did against Strongroom, there is no reason why the STREAK shouldn&rsquo;t reach double figures this time.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Woodman proved a popular venue for post-match drinks, food and Boa-baiting. Rumours of Chris Moyles also being in the pub remain unconfirmed but a good spot nonetheless.<o:p></o:p></p>
