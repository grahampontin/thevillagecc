<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Friday afternoon wasn't the most promising of preludes to the Village CC's 3rd annual tour to the wilds of Wiltshire. With severe weather warnings in place across the country Village doom-mongers were already predicting a wash out. Mid-way through the afternoon it looked like they were not going to be disappointed; the skies turned a dark yellow and&nbsp;the heaviest rain fall this side&nbsp;of the Apocalypse hammered&nbsp;it's way through London.</font></p>
<p>The traveling party was split in&nbsp;four. Deano, having taken Mrs Deano and the&nbsp;Village's youngest member to the grandparents, arrived safe and sound in Wiltshire&nbsp;before the worst of the conditions&nbsp;set in. Of the other&nbsp;three cars Rahilly, Pontin, Evans, Youdan and Rainford left the East at around 4.30, Richardson, Redfearn and Lord and Lady Bomb, the West at a similar hour, KP and MMJ set off at the eminently more sensible hour of 2pm.</p>
<p>What was less sensible was their decision to perform 3 laps of the M25 before&nbsp;setting off along the M4, in what we can only assume was intended to be&nbsp;some kind of NASA-inspired sling shot maneuver gone horribly wrong.&nbsp;Whatever their reasoning it would be fair to say that the spirits of the other travelers, by now stuck in the grid-lock of West London, were raised by the news that at 5.30pm MMJ and KP were &quot;still on the bloody M25&quot;.</p>
<p>The minutes turned through hours into what seemed like weeks as the tourists limped their way out of London and into the mother-of-all-traffic-jams on the M4. News of roadworks and landslides did little to soothe the tempers of the now highly pissed-off travelers, nor did it ease the pressure in Richardson's bladder, who having downed 6 cans of Official VCC Energy Drink, &quot;Relentless&quot;, was reported to&nbsp;be &quot;bursting for&nbsp;a piss&quot;.</p>
<p>Reports that later filtered through to this office that Richardson had wet himself just after Junction 16 proved unfounded, and the gigglings of the Captain and his companions were soon stifled by the news&nbsp;from a helpful passing vehicle that they had a flat tyre. A brief stint in the hard shoulder to asses the situation and a close shave with an improbably fast moving lorry later it was decided to move to safer ground&nbsp;and&nbsp;change the wheel. Early theories that the puncture had been caused by one of Richardson's army of discarded Relentless cans are yet to be substantiated.</p>
<p>Eventually the traffic relented and the plucky Village tourists arrived and Dog and Fox at 10.30, fully six hours after leaving and, most upsettingly,&nbsp;still sober. It would be fair to say that Bomb in particular went about sorting the second problem in double-quick time,&nbsp;half-and-half his weapon of choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so it was that not too long before 11pm the Village's 3rd game of Giants vs Dwarfs skittles began. Deano leading the Giants and MMJ the Dwarfs in what was to be a monumental tussle. The Giants made all the early running taking the first leg with a comfortable 8 point cushion. The end of the first leg heralded the arrival of Doctors Warner and King to be Giant and Dwarf respectively. This change of personnel improved the fortunes of the Dwarfs, and they secured the second leg to take the game into a third and final end.</p>
<p>At&nbsp;this stage the Sausage Cup, awarded to the Villager with the highest individual score,&nbsp;was looking like a two horse race with last year's winner, TJ O'Rahilly, and our host, Mr AA Page, leading the way.</p>
<p>The final leg came down to the final throw. Dwarf&nbsp;Captain MMJ requiring 9 pins to tie things up. No-one and had cleared the board before&nbsp;in the&nbsp;evening,&nbsp;and it wasn't to be for MMJ, his plucky seven leaving the Dwarfs 2 adrift and consigned to defeat. The sausage cup was an equally close run affair, but experience eventually told, Page coming through to take the trophy from a despondent Rahilly.</p>
<p>And with that the tourists dispersed to&nbsp;their various lodgings to rest in preparation for the supposed subject of this report: the game against the Further Friars.</p>
<p>Saturday dawned bright, if not exactly clear, and an early morning pitch inspection brought news of a playable track despite Friday's deluge. The fact that the Keevil Track is on the side of a hill may have had a lot to do with it. And so to Steeple Ashton: place of Buttcome, Lunch and Jailbait.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only on the Buttcome did Steeple Ashton disappoint, the Village men and women having to choose a different poison to lubricate their voices for the trip in KP's Crazy Bus from pub to ground.</p>
<p>Last to arrive at Lunch were DI and Marrow. It was assumed DI, rumoured to have brought the Bently, was having difficulty navigating round the tight country lanes. Imagine our surprise when Marrow and the Village's premier strike bowler were seen unfolding themselves from the confines of a ten year old electric green VW Polo. Mav muttered something about it being his sister's car before stopping to ask &quot;Bently?&quot;.</p>
<p>Lunch over with, the tourists made their various ways to the Crazy Bus and cars for the short trip to the Manor&nbsp;House at Keevil when, right on cue, the heavens opened. What was at first a light drizzle turned into&nbsp;genuine rain, so genuine in fact that no amount of Positive Mental Attitude or&nbsp;Sandal Wearing could prevent&nbsp;a determined last few from seeking&nbsp;cover under umbrellas.</p>
<p>Upon arrival at the ground the rain was still falling but there were signs of brightening skies. A few of the Village's more intrepid members picked their way over the electric fence, past a cow with a mysterious question mark emblazoned on its side&nbsp;and through the minefield of fresh cow pats to the pitch for an inspection. Astonishingly, despite a not insignificant amount of rain the pitch was in remarkably good condition. Unquestionably damp on top but still firmer than any wicket seen in London this year. Hopes were high that play could be had if only the rain would stop.</p>
<p>And stop it did. Without further ado, Pontin, MMJ and Friars Captain, AA&nbsp;Page, went out for the toss. Pontin then&nbsp;made a highly ill advised last minute decision to take the toss himself and the laws of probability were once again proven to be complete nonsense as he proceeded to lose his 6th toss of the season, having won only once. Unsurprisingly, on a damp, sloping wicket, Page&nbsp;inserted the Village.</p>
<p>Not long thereafter the scene was set, Pontin and Morgans&nbsp;took guard, Bomb, guesting for the Friars,&nbsp;took the new ball, and&nbsp;the spectators took cover as the skies once again threatened proceedings.</p>
<p>Bomb opened the bowling hoping to repeat last season's effort, trapping Morgans in a highly dubious LBW for a duck, but this year it was a different story and first blood&nbsp;Morgans as the Welsh Love Dragon drove&nbsp;Bomb crisply through mid-off for four. By this stage the drizzle&nbsp;had started up again and conditions were far from ideal for&nbsp;either the&nbsp;batting or fielding sides. Bomb continued to struggle from the&nbsp;Cow Pat end with&nbsp;the crease becoming&nbsp;ever more slippery, but remained economical if not threatening. There was time for one moment&nbsp;of drama before the drizzle intensified and&nbsp;forced the players to seek shelter, Pontin having a wild slash a short ball outside off stump and nicking the simplest of chances to the Wicket Keeper. The Captain had already turned to walk back up the slope when he was informed by his batting partner that the chance had been put down. Grateful for a second chance, Pontin set about his innings with perhaps even greater vigilance than we have become accustomed to.</p>
<p>After a short rain delay play resumed and the Village openers battled hard in the conditions to guide their side to 53 before Morgans took on a quick single to mid-on and was run out by a country mile. Enter Deano at number 3 and the 75-year-old left arm spinner, Bob Rham, to the attack from the Duck Pond End. Deano looked in aggressive mood but was cut off in his prime as a well struck sweep off the afore mentioned pensioner was plucked out of the air by one the Frair's more able fielders.</p>
<p>By this stage the track was so damp that even bowlers of Bob Rham's pace were having difficulty keeping their footing. Cue Bomb, in his new role as groundsman trotting to and fro with a bucket of sand. Suffice to say that by the end of the game the bowling crease more beach paradise than country fields.</p>
<p>Out strode&nbsp;one the Village's in-form batsmen,&nbsp;Marrow, looking to improve on his&nbsp;6 against Coach.&nbsp;The pair started well, Marrow using the short boundary&nbsp;behind him to punish Bob for a string of boundaries, while Pontin at the other end continued to anchor the innings but&nbsp;struggled to find scoring opportunities&nbsp;amongst the long, wet&nbsp;grass&nbsp;and multitude of fielders.</p>
<p>A change of bowling at the Cow Pat End, son of umpire replacing grandson of umpire, brought two more chances both off the Village's Captain. The first, a regulation catch at mid-on as Pontin tried to break the shackles, was shelled by 13-year-old-grandson-of-myopic-umpire and, in the following over,&nbsp;a diving chance in a similar position but off a far better struck shot was shelled,&nbsp;the captain living dangerously on what&nbsp;should really&nbsp;be thought of as 30 for&nbsp;3.</p>
<p>By this stage Marrow's serene &nbsp;progress had brought him level on scores with&nbsp;his nurdling Captain and taken the Village well past the 100 mark and towards the declaration. The ignominy of being outscored by a man who had been at the crease for only half as long and the constant baiting from the crowd seemed to finally get Pontin moving. One half chance went to Page short on the leg side before Pontin seized on the return on the 13-year-old from the Duck Pond End to smash 11 runs including the Village's only six of the day to narrowly pip Marrow to the half century mark and a well earned retirement. The crowd cheered perhaps as much with relief as anything else and no-one was more excited the Miami-Vice Lucarotti who strode out to&nbsp;face the music after a&nbsp;long stint with the pads on.</p>
<p>His stint wasn't to last much longer though, as the big-hitting Villager tried to up the run rate and had his shit&nbsp;ruined first up by a daisy cutter. His&nbsp;13-year-old slayer&nbsp;is the second youngest player to dismiss a Villager, Morgans holds the honor of being&nbsp;ruined by the youngest incidentally. And so to the wicket strode KP with the intention of getting Marrow to his 50 and seeing the Village towards 150 and declaration. Both of those he did, only a rain shower causing the Village to declare a little early on 144 for 3. A reasonable total given the heavy outfield, the fact that the Friars had 16 fielders and a 95-ball&nbsp;innings from Pontin that was variously described as &quot;turgid&quot;, &quot;mind-numbing&quot; and occasionally &quot;nuggety&quot;&nbsp;by only the very generous.</p>
<p>By now it was time for the Friars to do what they do best. Take Tea. A veritable banquet of sandwiches and snacks was brought forth from the cow pat infested car park accompanied by the traditional beer and wine chasers.</p>
<p>The weather by this stage had brightened somewhat and there was even the threat&nbsp;of some sunshine as the Frier's opening duo strode out to face the music. Village tactical masters Pontin and Lucarotti opted for a somewhat untraditional opening pair of KP and Deano, the latter hoping to use the slope to aid his off-spinners. But it was KP that struck first opening proceedings with a double wicket maiden, both batsmen bowled off their pads,&nbsp;to leave the Friars reeling at 0-2.</p>
<p>Here we should remember that the Friars had 16 batsmen, meaning the Village required another 13 wickets for victory or the Friars to bat for 20 overs after 6 o'clock for the draw.</p>
<p>Not satisfied with his opening wickets, KP proceeded to remove the Friars other opener, the same young man who had not so long ago ruined MMJ was himself ruined by a ball that nipped back up the hill. Things were looking desperate for the hosts. The Village&nbsp;then&nbsp;resorted to a first change pairing of Saul, making his bowling debut, and Craig. </p>
<p>Saul did not disappoint, taking a wicket in his first over, a good catch taken and short fine leg as the batsman attempted to take advantage of the short straight boundaries. With the wicket he earned himself the prize every village bowler wanted - The chance to dismiss the A-Bomb. </p>
<p>Bomb started brightly taking runs through off and leg sides before he very nearly gave Saul his prize, a firmly struck drive put down by a diving&nbsp;Pontin at cover.&nbsp;Meanwhile&nbsp;Craig was keeping the pressure on at the other end,&nbsp;two maidens the highlight of tidy&nbsp;5 over spell.</p>
<p>By now the Village needed wickets, Bomb had settled nicely and had found an able partner in Nick (I think he was called Nick anyway, I could be wrong). On came strike bowling pair&nbsp;Richardson and Ireland and it was Richardson who got the break through, Bomb carving a high chance to KP who took an excellent catch over his shoulder on the run at what one might call a sort of square cover position. The Village were into the tail and Umpire Page was heard informing DI that &quot;this was a good a chance all you'll ever get to take a hat-trick&quot;.</p>
<p>No hat-trick, but a couple of straight-forward wickets for DI, who was far too full, fast and straight for the Friars. Nick was now joined by a curly haired chap who showed a great deal of stick-ability if not a great talent for stroke making.&nbsp;Stout resistance in the next over or so saw Pontin shuffle the bowling pack again, this time Rahilly&nbsp;coming on to&nbsp;replace DI and Morgans for Richardson. </p>
<p>Rahilly opened tidily, his Chinamen causing problems as they turned down the slope and he didn't have&nbsp;long to wait for the break through as Nick's previously vigilant partner went for a huge mow down the ground. The steepling chance was well taken by Marrow, who caused great controversy by throwing the ball up in celebration before careering over the boundary rope and into the surrounding ditch. &quot;The ball wasn't under control&quot; complained the batsmen and, oddly, Morgans. But Page's finger was raised and the batsman had to go. The next wicket went to Rahilly as well, a smart catch taken by the ever reliable mits of Morgans at square leg.</p>
<p>Morgans' bowling on the other hand&nbsp;has been known to be somewhat&nbsp;less than reliable. His only over on this occasion was one from the Steve Harmison school of bowling, featuring a plethora&nbsp;of wides and no-balls, to go with the regulation 6 legal deliveries and a wicket -&nbsp;a neat bit of work from Youdan behind the stumps, combined with the fact the batsman couldn't see the crease under all the sand and sawdust, lead to a rare dismissal by stumping.</p>
<p>The Love Dragon's 20 ball over&nbsp;had left things&nbsp;a little too close for comfort -&nbsp;Pontin recalled KP to the attack and backed himself replacing Rahilly&nbsp;at the&nbsp;Mysterious&nbsp;Cow End&nbsp;- The Friar's Target? 20 from the last 4 overs. </p>
<p>Pontin's overs were uneventful, the skipper conceding 11 for no wicket to&nbsp;go with KP's singleton over and leave the Kiwi with 8 runs to play with in the final over. In the end&nbsp;it was more comfortable than it might have been, KP removing the well set Nick with a full delivery&nbsp;for 62. Another tail-ender,&nbsp;clearly under the influence of substances unknown,&nbsp;fell next ball to leave the Village with a sniff of a highly improbable victory and&nbsp;KP with a&nbsp;fivefer.&nbsp;Septuagenarian Bob and AA Page were left to bat and only 2 deliveries remaining. The field was set, 4 slips, 2 gullies and everyone else round the bat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As it turned out Bob&nbsp;was more than a match for the bowling, protecting the (by now pissed) Page from having to face a ball and scoring a single with a classical square drive off the last ball of the match. In truth the players had begun shaking hands and congratulating each other long before Bob made it to the far end for his one, but it would have been a harsh fielding side that would have run the man out after an excellent contribution with bat and ball.</p>
<p>Man of the Match? A tricky one. KP for his fivefer? Pontin or Marrow for their 50s? MMJ for his goldie?&nbsp;In the end a Village fivefer is such a rare&nbsp;occurrence that it has to go to KP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Match over&nbsp;with, the men, women and children of Village and Friars adjourned to the Bell on the Common where Page had organised a BBQ of pre-cooked, chicken, deep-fried sausages and &quot;medium-rare&quot; burgers. So hungry were the gathered hoards that each fresh batch of&nbsp;hastily microwaved buns were snapped up almost as soon they arrived. </p>
<p>The 6X flowed, the larger drinkers were tolerated while DI's attempts to buy Madeira were scorned by players and&nbsp;bartenders alike. Suitably fed and watered it was time for the presentation of the Pants. For those not aware it had been decided some time ago that to thank Page for his efforts this season we should buy him some VCC branded pants. And so we did. The people cheered and cameras, though thankfully not Page,&nbsp;flashed.</p>
<p>By this stage in the evening, the more intrepid Villagers had found the pool table and the less coherent of the WAGs had found tequila. And so it was that another tremendous day in Wessex ended with&nbsp;happy Villagers playing pool, rating each other's chat and reminding Bomb that he really couldn't, under any circumstances, take out a horse with a head butt.</p>
