<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Shortly after our arrival at the Red Bull, the manner in which the opposition were taking the game was clear to all when it was seen that they were indulging in a pre-match bevy or two.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Village, making up for their lack of quality with professionalism, abstained.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All, that is, except for one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I will not name names. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>However, I will say that he was a man of note and he spent the day looking at the midwicket boundary!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Due to KP being late and hung over (a claim which he refutes, stating &ldquo;I was held up on the motorway.&rdquo;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The same motorway which Maj used who, incidently, turned up about an hour before kick-off!) The A-Bomb stepped up to the plate as Miami Vice and walked into the middle of the pitch to toss with Page.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Inevitably, Page won and chose to bat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At the time, it seemed the obvious choice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But the Gods were smiling on The Village and the variable cloud cover favoured the team batting second in the end.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The first example of this was the ball swinging all over the place from White&rsquo;s opening over.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There were gasps from seasoned Villagers as the Parp look-a-like swung ball after ball into the hapless batsmen.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">At the other end, <st1:state><st1:place>Tex</st1:place></st1:state> was bowling some hard-to-play balls and the occasional beauty as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, they were too good for the batsmen and he spent much of the early part of his spell frustrated at their inability to get close enough to them to find the edge.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">However, they did not have to wait too long for the 1<sup>st</sup> wicket.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bomb, yelling like Sharapova as always, slung in an unplayable inswinging yorker and removed the opening batsman&rsquo;s middle stump through bat and pad.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A flurry of wickets then ensued with two catches and a run-out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The opposition were stunned at being reduced to 20 odd for 4 and decided it was time to unleash one of their two secret weapons.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A batsman we all feared, thinking he was a Pakistani ringer, strode purposefully into the middle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He promptly received one of the best deliveries I have ever seen, ladies and gentlemen, (of off A. White) that jagged up into his chest and he edged behind off of the inside of his bat to be caught behind by Prep. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Prep and Bomb were jumping with delight only to notice the batsman still stood in his crease.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He had unashamedly failed to walk and the umpire refused to give him, despicable behaviour.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Fired up by such unsportsmanlike deeds, Wake quickly dismissed the dishonourable batsman in the only way the umpire could not deny; an <st1:city><st1:place>Anderson</st1:place></st1:city> special, pitching on middle and moving off the pitch to clip the top of off stump.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">There then followed a period of domination by the batting team.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 1<sup>st</sup> change bowlers could not remove the middle order and the oppo started to put on a respectable score.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Their only batsman to score highly set about Chris&rsquo; inswingers, hoiking repeatedly over midwicket.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He made it onto 49 before being trapped in front and cruelly sent back to the pavilion by the Louse, who had come disguised as a hairdresser.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It was now the time that all of The Village had been looking forward to. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>A. A. Page took guard, edged one down leg for 4 and was then bamboozled by one of Saul&rsquo;s deliveries that was moving so slowly it turned in the wind and he edged it behind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Village rejoiced.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">With 130 to chase, KP, now sobered up and resuming captaincy, was given the luxury of opening with Andy and HPrep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The crowd were on the edge of their seats expecting some big hitting stuff.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Tentative stuff followed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There were some nudges and nurdles and a severe lack of quick singles!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Beard was bowling accurately (despite having just finished what must have been his 5th pint) and at the other end it was the dreaded, the feared, the surprisingly small, The Machine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The little man (???) came steaming in from 1000 yards time after time bouncing the ball into the poor openers&rsquo; muscled chests.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The 1<sup>st</sup> to decide he&rsquo;d had enough was <st1:city><st1:place>Richardson</st1:place></st1:city>, out hit in front.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The soon-to-depart dee-dar was uncharacteristically upset about being given LB.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Marcus came in at three with a determined and gritty attitude in tow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was a good thing he did as shortly afterwards both Prep and The Example were clean bowled by M. A. Chine, who had finally got reward for an excellent spell.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">With the dangerous opening bowlers gone, KP, apparently with a clear head now, joined Marrow in the middle and the two set about upping the stagnating run-rate with some quick singles and the occasional flourish against some friendly bowling.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Cambs started to see the game going away from them and brought on a decent pacer who had some vicious swing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This brought a few defensive shots and some played and misses out of the batsmen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But it was too late, the target run rate was now down to 2 or 3 an over and the buoyant Village still had 7 wickets in hand.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It all ended in a peculiar fashion when one of the <st1:place><st1:placename>Cambs</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype></st1:place> fielders said The Village needed six runs to win, then M. A. Chine, returning for one at the death, bowled an inswinging bouncer which beat everyone, including Page who was keeping wicket, and everyone walked off before the ball had even been fetched back from just short of the boundary!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The oppo were obviously desperate for their next pint.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Villager of the Match&hellip;?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A three way tie between:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Bomb, for one of the best spells a Villager has ever bowled,</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">KP for some big hitting stuff that saw him fall two short of the 1<sup>st</sup> landmark, and</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Marrow for his excellent nurdling and quick running to make a much needed 33.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It was then all of to town for&nbsp;a ruby, except for Parp and Chris MoN who were left behind to set up Camp Autism.</font></p>
