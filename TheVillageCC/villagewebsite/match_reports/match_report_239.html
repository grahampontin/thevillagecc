<conditions><p>Decent pitch with some lateral movement. Overcast. Swung like a boomerang all day.</p> </conditions><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; white-space: pre-wrap; line-height: 1.15;">After a heroic (some would say extremely lucky) win over Southwark and Lambeth earlier in the season, the VCC once again ventured south of the river to take them on at their home ground. And before the game had even started, we ran into problems:</span><br />

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">1) Half the team were late.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">2) Ekky, though present, had flu.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">3) Mav had a hangover and so had decided not to grace us with his presence.</span></p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Oh dear. This wasn&rsquo;t going to be easy. We lost the toss and the 10 plucky Villagers eventually took the field. It all began rather well, with two wickets going down in Boa&rsquo;s first over - Burton unlucky to see an inside edge dribble back on to the stumps, and the promoted Main going for 0 after trying spank one out of the park.</span></p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Unfortunately, that was about as good as it got for the rest of the day. Boa and AB bowled tightly at Hoskin and Packer but couldn&rsquo;t get either of them out, and then the two began to expand and exposed the soft underbelly of the VCC&rsquo;s bowling, clobbering a poorly Gupte, an under-par Naz and the rest of the change offerings at a run a ball or better. By the time our openers returned Hoskin had reached his ton and Packer was rapidly closing in on his. Boa managed to pick up another one after the latter went for one big hit too many: AB then had Hoskin dropped at long on, but he went the next over trying to hit a big one off makeshift death bowler Bird. S&amp;L finished on 260: probably 40 above par on a good wicket offering a little bit of help to the bowlers. The Village took a desultory lunch during a mid-innings rain shower.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">We needed a good start. This was easier said than done given that S&amp;L&rsquo;s bowling line up included the skiddy inswing of Burton, the nagging away swing of W Packer and above all his left handed brother H Packer, who bowled for Oxford University and was really rather fast. Given that our batting was a little more shallow than usual our top order opted for caution against the three horsemen of the bowling apocalypse. </span></p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">That they made it to drinks only two down was to some degree a success: Bird and Harty had both gone to catches in the covers, but we&rsquo;d seen off most of the threatening overs. The trouble was that we&rsquo;d done so at the price of a slow run-rate, and now we needed to go at 10 an over against the second string. A big ask, as Bob Willis might say. Our chances of doing so took a hit when AB went for another maximum against the spinner, missed it and was bowled, but Sam came in and played an absolute blinder, belting some huge sixes, one ending up in a nearby netball court. </span></p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">For quite some time we managed to keep up with the rate: Bilal was looking like he and Sam might take it home until an excellent boundary catch from Packer H, and C-Pitch showed how much he&rsquo;s improved with a couple of delightful Pontinesque cross court forehands. As Sam brought up his 50 one could tell S&amp;L were getting nervous, with a highly defensive field and not too many overs left from their big guns to come. </span></p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Indeed, it was only the return of H Packer that finally killed the Village&rsquo;s chances. He removed both Sam and Naz in the same over, both to excellent takes by the keeper, and by the time no 11 Hampton, who&rsquo;d only turned up to watch the end of the game, was sent in to bat, the cause was lost.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">In the end a weakened Village had put up a decent fight against one of the best teams we&rsquo;ll play all year, and drinks with the oppo were, as always, a lot of fun. Would a third front-line bowler (and tenth fielder) have made the difference? Hard to say. It would certainly have been closer.</span></p>

<br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Village idiot: Guess.</span></span></p>
