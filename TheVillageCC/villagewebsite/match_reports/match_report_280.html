Many villagers had been at the Oval to witness the highest-scoring T20 game ever in England the previous night, but the thick outfield indicated that value for your shots would be hard to come by. </span></p>

Morgan, coming up the hill, was particularly tight. Cressey was looking good through the offside, pinging a drive to the boundary off Morgan, while JdM took consecutive sixes off the first-change bowler. On 70-odd for 0, though, Cressey got one that kept low off the zippy Roussouw, and Potty came in to help see the Village to 95-1 at drinks. </span></p>

Pig and Potty kept things ticking along for a few more overs, but it was still tough to get the ball away and the pair of them, plus Troja, lost their wickets trying to force the issue. There was a good cameo partnership between Klav and Bosh before Tommo and Pitch made sure the Village used up every last ball of the innings. At 199/9, the villagers knew it was a decent total on what&rsquo;s always a difficult pitch, but fielding and bowling would have to be top-notch.</span></p>

A big six down the ground off Bilal&rsquo;s first over started to sow a few seeds of doubt in Village minds - particularly as the new ball was lost, never to be found (Tommo wasn&rsquo;t happy with this turn of events). Bilal had more control with the older ball, though, and the run rate started to get pegged back, culminating in him trapping one of the openers LBW. Klav came on first change from the top and managed to turn the game in one over, snaring the second opener LB before producing a ripper that clipped the top of off after the batsman played a leave. </span></p>

Just when the Village needed a wicket, Pitch - who had come on for EK - managed to get Clack to hole out to Bilal at cow (a catch that, everyone agreed afterwards, was never in doubt). This wicket brought Rossouw, a handy cricketer who showed his ability taking Cressey for 10 in an over soon after coming in. Cressey struck back, however, taking Frecknall&rsquo;s leg stump to break up a partnership that was causing jitters. Troja took the big scalp, though, forcing a leading edge from Roussouw that was well caught by pig at short cover. The Village managed to wrap up the remaining wickets without too much fuss, but at around the 23-over mark the game had been in the balance and it was far closer than the final 62-run margin suggested. </span></p>
