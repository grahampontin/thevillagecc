<p>And so back to Springfield Park, scene of the Village's first league win of the 2007 season against Island. Hopes were not high for a batting paradise, but captain GCHQ Pontin had been able to name a side strong in all respects, especially in the bowling department. Confidence was high, despite the recent setback against the Old Fallopians at Parliament Hill, with much banter taking place on the Guestbook in the absence of perennial pedant AEMcC Richardson. Richardson's phantom 180 against the Rain Men the previous week was of course curtailed before a ball had been bowled due to persistent rain, and the mercurial all-rounder's trip to the legendary cricketing bazaar of Intersport (Wood Green) to select a new wand had resulted in Harry Potter-esque scenes, with the role of former (female) Warwickshire leg spinner ably hammed up by John Hurt and various cricketing accessories liberally distributed about the shop, a new Woodworm finally proving to be the right choice.</p>
<p>Richardson was the first Village arrival in the balmy weathers of saturday lunchtime, but he was greeted by the extraordinary scene of the Coach side warming up a full 45 minutes before the call of 'play'. Quickly on the phone to his captain to report the development, Richardson set about inspecting the 'pitch', as prepared by Hackney Council's crack squad of ploughmen. It could best be described as 'treacherous', with a thin covering of hard, sun-baked soil covering a pudding with no bounce at all. As the Villagers gathered, Pontin called correctly and inserted the Coach, despite there only being eight fielders ready. Tom Rahilly, sporting a fetching baby blue Village Leisure Wear (TM) Polo Shirt, was drafted in to fill the breach. </p>
<p>The heat made bowling first a brave gamble, but Pontin knew he could rely on mercurial openers Maverick DI and KPK Bowman to make an impression, which they duly did, the first dozen or so balls all penetrating the surface of the pitch and leaving dangerous looking holes thereon. Crucially, the opening barrage proved impossible for the plucky Coach batsmen to get away and when KP broke through after fifteen balls of the innings, the Coach only had two on the board. Between them, they conceded only eight of the opening six overs, and Coach were already struggling with the conditions and the Village's bowling. </p>
<p>Rob Sibson's return to the Village fold was initially wayward, prompting the captain to replace him early in his spell with the Relentless-fuelled Richardson, hopping from foot to foot like a lizard on hot sand. With the A Bomb proving a handful at the other end, Richardson removed the second opener after an ill-conceived attempt at a slower ball had nearly removed said opener's nose. Richardson made further inroads, removing the number three with a sustained spell of aiming at his toes, finally beating him with one that was played on. The big man Schnadhorst sallied forth to the crease, aware that the he had been out first ball against Richardson's bowling at the end of last season. His enormous legs put in an enormous stride, the ball struck the pad halfway up, and despite the Village's best efforts with the appeal, he escaped a repeat. Inspired captaincy proved his undoing, with Richardson taking the catch in the next over at short midwicket. Pontin had ordered him to backward square, but the wilful Yorkshireman had disobeyed, and Schnadhorst was gone. </p>
<p>Coach, struggling at this point to score runs, were buoyed by the eventual presence of Adam, brought to the crease after a successful A Bomb LBW shout that could best be described as the work of Monty Panesar's malco brother, and some inspired line and length stuff from Strobes which removed Shane. Adam made hay (and 47) in the sun, eventually falling to the last ball of Toby's fifth over, a feat matched by KP Bowman, who also took a wicket with his last ball. Sibbo removed the number 10, hilariously recorded in the Village scorebook as 'Dirty Pads', caught by Gordon FtW, much to Gordon's surprise and relief. Richardson's declaration to Mav that the number 11 aws a ferret (sent in after the rabbits), though with little to no basis in fact, inspired the big seamer, who produced the match's finest delivery, a perfectly shaped inswinger, to remove him and bring the innings to a close on 127. Not a big total, but not an easy to pitch to bat on, and the Village prepared themselves for a tough time at the crease.</p>
<p>So it proved. Schnadhorst, bowling with a fire and at a pace unmatched in the game, was lethal, removing Pontin, Strobes and H Bomb in a devastating opening spell of 3-8. The big man looks to be well over the injury that reduced his speed quite considerably last season, and will be a threat to all he comes up against. A Bomb had quietly progressed through the openers, and was looking set - in the way that only he can - despite some quality stuff from Australian Ian, who despite not having a wicket to his name almost certainly was responsible for Adam's dismissal of Richardson: not concentrating, perhaps, on the perceived weaker bowler, as Ian had removed him four or five times in the past. Saul moved the score on with a quickfire 8, but the Village were struggling badly on 47-5 at the halfway stage.</p>
<p>After the drinks break, Bomb and Marcus MoB set about the total like men possessed, with massive commitment, and no small amount of pluck and guile allowing them to survive some tricky bowling from the Coach veterans. Coach suffered from a string of no balls failing to bounce altogether, and Village progressed to level the scores after 30 overs. Controversy reigned in another form, with Hanson outrageously triggering Marcus LBW, despite the number 7's considerable inside edge onto the pad. Whether Hanson got the call wrong or needs a lesson in the rules is still subject to debate. He is thought to have rung one Neil Johnson during the evening after the game seeking consolation and coping strategies. </p>
<p>Despite KP's, umpire Richardson's and the Coach's best efforts, A Bomb could not be removed and hit the winning runs in the 31st over, after surviving a close LBW shout, and took the plaudits and man of the match with his 41 not out, alongside his earlier contribution with the ball of 2-15 off 5 overs. Richardson, asked to nominate the MoM, described watching Bomb bat as 'excruciating', but was ignored, the Bomb simply stating: 'Can't talk, choinas. Too pumped.' </p>
<p>A good day all round, with Hanson cementing his claim on the Village idiot award with an ambitious attempt at a rabona resulting in him kicking away his own standing leg and falling flat on his arse. Villagers celebrated largely by going home, though a band of intrepid players and WGAOAHOs braved the wilds of Stoke Newington, where much pizza and beer was (were?) consumed, and much post-mortem discussion went on. Pontin has put out the call to Villagers to 'get keen' for the match against London Fields on the 16th, with the top of the table clash potentially destined to be a turning point in the season. </p>
