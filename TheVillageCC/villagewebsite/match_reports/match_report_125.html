<conditions><p>Damp of ground but mercifully dry overhead for the most part.</p> </conditions><p>It seems I&nbsp;have to write this match report every year and in many ways I could just pick up and use the beginning of last year's report for things as ever began thusly:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Villagers attempt to leave London Westward for the Kingdom of Wessex - Traffic is shit, people arrive late.</li>
    <li>Skittles begin using the time honoured Giants vs Dwarfs method of team selection</li>
    <li>A simple supper of sausages is served</li>
    <li>Rahilly and Morgs get uber competative.</li>
    <li>A girl wins the sausage cup:&nbsp;first prize a sausage and an uncomfotably familiar moment with Page&nbsp;(this time Jenny WAG&nbsp;of KP)</li>
    <li>Plims staggers around blind drunk on cider.</li>
    <li>The special bus takes drunken Villagers back to their lodgings.</li>
</ul>
<p>So it was, and so it ever shall be.</p>
<p>Next morning the traveling folk of the Village arose and made their way to Steeple Ashton, one time home of two barmaids whose assets have gone down in Village legend along side the time Morgs was silhoetted &quot;sudding himself&quot;&nbsp;through the bathroom window at 250 The Common, Holt. Despite the lack of barmaid-based eye candy cricketers of Friars and Village alike enjoyed a restorative pre-match buffet of sandwiches, sausages and unfortunately named ale.</p>
<p>And so to Keevil Manor for the game. The Village had very generously agreed to lend the Friars KP, Bomb and Plims. Given that this constituted two thirds of our front-line pace attack and two of our top order batsmen it may be seen in hindsight as a rather generous gesture, but such is the world of&nbsp;friendly cricket.</p>
<p>As much by agreement as any process of coin tossing the Village were having a bat.&nbsp;Morgs and your esteemed&nbsp;author taking to the wicket, Morgs&nbsp;in agressive mood and whilst I looked to&nbsp;emulate&nbsp;performances of years gone by inducing&nbsp;the fielding side into&nbsp;a state of near coma with a&nbsp;selection of blocks&nbsp;and pokes which would&nbsp;make Colly look like KP.</p>
<p>It was all plain&nbsp;sailing to begin with, barring one bizarre incidenet where your corresepondent was given out lbw by the really very deaf Umpire Fielden off a huge inside edge only for Plims and Page to have the appeal withdrawn,&nbsp;49 for the opening wicket and a sense that this was an ok time to be batting. But the&nbsp;Bomb, opening from the Car Park End had unsettled Morgs on a&nbsp;number of occasions with&nbsp;his swing and&nbsp;use of&nbsp;the slope. Morgs had opted for all out attack on the grounds that &quot;Oooh, I'm just as likely to get out defending and this way at least I'll make some runs&quot;. 29 of them, in fact, before he was cleaned up by Bomb, charging down the wicket to york himself. Foolish.</p>
<p>Sam was next in and really&nbsp;should have gone first ball, dropped at slip. Slip catches are never easy but this one was as easy as they&nbsp;get - the fielder understandably upset with his effort. Thankfully for the&nbsp;Friars it wasn't to be an expensive error, Sam succuming to a rare straight one from KP, lbw for&nbsp;5.</p>
<p>Come to the wicket Marrow, captain for the day,&nbsp;with a chance to stabalise an innings teetering on 56-2. It wasn't&nbsp;to be though, KP&nbsp;claiming the scalp of your&nbsp;correspondent, caught at short leg&nbsp;for the 2nd time this season trying to work the ball&nbsp;off the hips.</p>
<p>Cue an inevitable collapse. Hom-Ass came and went for&nbsp;0, Andy&nbsp;for 1 in controversial circumstances - a 3 bounce yorker&nbsp;bowling him. But&nbsp;where was the third bounce? What exactly are the rules on this? Did Parp! no&nbsp;ball it from sqaure leg? Who knows.&nbsp;It was an unflattering wicket for all concerned, but the scorebook reads: Richardson b. Anderson 1.</p>
<p>Anderson&nbsp;then accounted for Marrow also bowled, though this a rather&nbsp;better wicket, a misjudgement of the length and an injudicious selection of the cut&nbsp;shot accounting for the Village Captain.</p>
<p>It was looking bad for the Village. But an excellent lower order knock of 21 from&nbsp;The Risen Christ propelled the Village&nbsp;towards respectability and an Anderson and Monty-esq final wicket partnership&nbsp;of 20ish between Parp! and Louse pushed the visitors to a reasonable, if&nbsp;slightly below par, 138.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Tea&nbsp;</strong>was had.</li>
    <li>There were sandwiches, beer and wine.</li>
    <li>Bomb had too much&nbsp;to drink&nbsp;and&nbsp;insisted on batting&nbsp;down the order.</li>
    <li>Louse wandered around the boundary with a gaggle of WAGs talking about his feelings</li>
</ul>
<p>So it was, so it ever shall be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>KP&nbsp;and Palmer opened proceedings for the Friars, against an untried new ball combination of&nbsp;&nbsp;A-Rich and Louse. Palmer looked secure, if stodgy, but it was KP&nbsp;who really took the fight to the opposition. A fine 44 was a comination of defence and sensable aggresion, until he finally got over excited and holed out the Morgs, patroling cow corner off the ever-economical Francis.</p>
<p>The Friars had 80 on the board already though and there was a sense that the damage was already done.</p>
<p>But a Village-esque middle order collapse, Tupper 0, Plimmer 0, Hawes 4 and the run out of opener Palmer for 34 left the Village with a sniff of a draw.</p>
<p>Anderson and Bomb were at the wicket though and with the required rate only 4 an over it was always going to be difficult. Marrow bowled well and Richardson then Louse returned for second spells but a combination of decent batting and poor fielding allowed a boundary an over to be forthcoming and the game to slip away. The Friars reaching the target with 2 overs to spare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The evening held something new for The Village:&nbsp;Charity Peking Duck Racing in Holt. &quot;What the hell is that?&quot;&nbsp;the travellers asked. &quot;There will be a bar and music&quot;&nbsp;was the reply. They were satisfied.</p>
<p>Trying to set this scene perhaps requires a greater command of prose than is held by your scientifically minded author, but it was a bit like this:&nbsp;Upon entering the garden of a small stately home looking building, complete with giant willow and various flowering plants, the arriving Villagers were greeted by a pointy hat wearing, Chinese dress wearing lady with&nbsp;mascarra applied&nbsp;so as to give the appearence of &quot;slitty eyes&quot;.&nbsp;&quot;Was this going to be a bit racist?&quot;&nbsp;the ever PC&nbsp;Rahilly&nbsp;had&nbsp;asked on the way. A good question as it turned out.</p>
<p>As promised there was indeed a bar and there&nbsp;was indeed&nbsp;music&nbsp;and there was indeed a BBQ. All good so far.</p>
<p>Good went to better when the turgid Crowded-House-loving-one-man-and-his-guitar band stopped&nbsp;playing a selection of tunes only likely to&nbsp;be heard on Magic or perhaps soon to be heard on <em>Drivetime&nbsp;with Louse,&nbsp;</em>and instead allowed the disco-in-a-box to begin.</p>
<p>It was, at this point&nbsp;still broad day light,&nbsp;but this was not to&nbsp;put off the drunked middle-aged locals who engaged in&nbsp;some very very amusing dancing. One man, Bomb's new hero, was suffiently free of inhibitions that he&nbsp;had the audacity to attempt to grope FranBell's chest and Kate-Rich's bottom in one fluid movement.&nbsp;Think office party in a garden. Only weirder.</p>
<p>Things, as they say, can only get better and as dark descended upon the garden and inhebriation&nbsp;upon&nbsp;the cricketers and WAGs the disco moved&nbsp;into full swing. Louse and Tash WAG of Marrow&nbsp;set&nbsp;the ball rolling with&nbsp;a most extraordinaryly coordinated&nbsp;dance to Footlose. This had&nbsp;to&nbsp;be seen to be believed. It was majestic. In truth Louse&nbsp;was a poor second&nbsp;best but second in a display of this genius&nbsp;holds no shame.</p>
<p>And then it came. The medaly that all pissed people in the late 20s want to hear: Chesny's One and Only and&nbsp;Summer of 69 could have been followed by&nbsp;Living on a Prayer, but throw in a bit&nbsp;of proclaimer magic and you&nbsp;can see&nbsp;where this is going.</p>
<p>By midnight when the&nbsp;disco was terminated there were only Villagers left. The bar&nbsp;had been dismanteled around the oblivious revelers and it was clear that it was time to get a move on. If someone could have turned the bar lights up really bright this would have been the time. And so home and to bed, tomorrow would be another day, and Bomb would be hungover and asking to bat down order again.</p>
