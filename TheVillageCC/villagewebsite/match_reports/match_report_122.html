<p style="text-align: left;">To Burnham near Slough, then, where the Village were set to play the toughest fixture they'd attempt this season, the mighty BBC Mishits. This was a team that Bomb had played for - and against - a few times and had witnessed their talent at first hand. Proper fast bowlers, batsmen for whom hitting hundreds was a thing of habit, spin bowlers who actually spun the ball, a tendency to be South African - all these things were lying in wait. He didn't, to be frank, fancy our chances.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><u><strong>In Your Face Punter</strong></u></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So let's get our good fortune out of the way first. Their fastest bowler, a chap called Richard who bowls at a pace somewhere between Shoaib Akhtar and Mav's car on the M4, and who also has a tendency to score tons entirely in sixes over midwicket had, it emerged, emigrated the week before the game. Fortunately he'd left the team something to remember him by - in his final game he'd induced a slip chance which had flown towards their best batsman, who'd taken the ball on the end of his finger. And ended up in hospital, because it had snapped in half. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The week before, the team's second best batsman had stormed out of the club due to a bad-tempered game in which he'd been called for a no-ball for not announcing his action (thank God we don't play many games that are <em>that </em>competitive), and he'd taken his selection of South African ringers with him. The Mishits will undoubtedly be back - it's a sign of their strength that with all these people missing they still put out a team that wasn't short of ability.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><u><strong>Monty Panesar MBE</strong></u></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our luck continued to improve when KP won the toss, and elected to bat on a pitch that looked an absolute belter. Hindle and Potty went out to face the music. At one end a chap called Keats was bowling at a decent pace and finding some good swing away from the bat to lure Tarka into a drive that looped to cover. It was beautiful bowling, and as well we know a thing of beauty is a joy forever. Hindle passed into nothingness. At the other end, a surprise. Well, three surprises. a) Ryan Sidebottom appeared to be bowling and b) Ryan Sidebottom appeared to be bowling left arm chinamen and c) Ryan Sidebottom appeared to be finding masses of turn and bounce.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">No doubt confused by these developments, Collyalike and general fitness maniac Ed Hayles called Potty through for a swift single to the keeper and was out to a direct hit. Brother Will then attempted to cut Sideshow, and was bowled as the ball ripped back into him. Quietly, on the boundary's edge, an Indian off spinner licked his lips.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>I know some people have criticised Ian Bell in the past, but I'm not one of them</u></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Village then, were struggling. Potty and Bomb, their opening partnership separated in a bid to keep opposition and teammates alike awake, were together after all. But 60-4 soon became not many more for five after the elderly John Blake stepped up to bowl, Pontin shuffled across his crease and was plumb LBW to one that just jagged back into him a touch. Now for the Old Village, the prospect of a recovery would probably have been out of the question. We'd just have been glad we weren't six down. Oh, there goes another one. But the Village of 2009 has a) steel b) spunk c) guts and above all d) People who aren't English low down the batting order.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So Bomb and Bun (and yes, I'm currently writing the TV pitch for CBeebies) began the rebuilding process. First they scampered some singles, then they began to run twos and threes. It was tough work - a big boundary and nagging slow bowling meant that both of them were well and truly shagged by the time they were done. They put on nearly 100 and began to swing the balance back towards the Village. Bun went for 37 attempting a second massive six, while Bomb was just starting to play some more expansive shots when he chipped a drive straight back to the bowler for 54. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><u><strong>You know where you can stick your dossier, don't you Justin?</strong></u></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The momentum was shifting our way, but we were far from out of the woods. On this pitch it looked like 250 would be a par score in our 40 overs. PK Bowman strode to the wicket and began to finish the job, clubbing a handy 21, but it took two very special innings to seal the deal and get us up to a winning position. Eklavya's innings was a wonderful bit of lower order batting - elegant and full of his trademark wristy flicks, it was as always a pleasure to watch. At the other end, David &quot;David Ireland&quot; Ireland, who'd even turned up on time*, played perhaps his finest ever Village innings. Granted, the bowlers were tiring and gave him some loose balls. But they had to be put away, and he didn't miss a trick, even lofting one full toss off his legs for a huge six. 264 on the board, and the Villagers were confident. Tea was taken in the company of some slightly scary types who were watching the Community Shield in the pavillion and supporting Chelsea.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><u><strong>Trott's every bit as English as I am</strong></u></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, the Village took the field with a decent bowling attack and plenty of scoreboard pressure. Ben Rhys Evans and DI took the new cherry, and both bowled quickly, though they took a while to find their line. DI struck first, trapping the BBC opener bang in front, and Ben followed up that success by jagging one back into the number 3 to bowl him. A fine start, and there was to be no let up in the pressure as the New Zealand pairing of Bun and KP took first change and instantly found a tight off stump line. Khame Persaud's promising and stylish innings was cut short as he attempted to work KP through the leg side - the leading edge was gobbled up by a hungry and highly pumped Louse, and when Morris edged Bun for Tarka to take a blinding catch in the gully, the game was all but up.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, the BBC had other ideas, and Keates and Preest lead a spirited fightback. Keates flashed away at KP outside off stump, sending him through and over the slips several times, and both climbed into the Louse, spanking him out of the attack. The BBC began to dream the impossible dream.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Aw look, Siddle's a direct replacement for Glenn McGrath?</u></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And so to the final act. Cometh the hour, cometh the Gupta. By his own admission the Example's struggled with the ball this season, probably more due to lack of overs than anything - but on this pitch, with its turn and bounce, he was absolutely lethal. He broke the partnership in his first over with a flighted off break that ripped back into Preest, and from that point on the Mishits' tail could get nowhere near him. His quicker ball accounted for two wickets, leaving the stumps flat on the floor and the batsmen utterly confuddled, and in between he was extracting so much turn that it seemed he'd get a wicket every other ball. In fact he almost did: no exaggeration to say his final analysis of 4-9 did him justice.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The BBC had been rolled out for 116, and the job was done. There was time for beers in the pavillion and a late train home - a marvellous Sunday. While they weren't the strongest oppo we've played this season, the BBC were still up there: there's a strong case that this was our best performance of 2009, on account of the fact that we fought back with the bat and bowled with excellent discipline.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><u><strong>Paul Collingwood has taken the Ashes off your lot twice</strong></u></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Awards then: plenty of contenders: AB for 54 to get us back into the game, Bun for 37 and a good spell of 1-9, DI for his innings and a tight start with the new ball, but Gupta shades them all - he also had an excellent all round game, but he does it all with such style that he gets the purists' vote.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Village idiot is very, very tough: even perennial competitior DI seems to be out of the running this week. So that only leaves one option: well done done Punter, you've finally won something over here.</p>
