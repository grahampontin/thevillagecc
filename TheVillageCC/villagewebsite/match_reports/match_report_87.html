<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Village Twenty20 match against The Informals was played out on a warm summer&rsquo;s evening at the picturesque grounds of Alexandra Palace. Prior to the match, the team subjected themselves to an eight-hour guestbook blackboard session under the watchful eye of Battingmaester Bomb (plus his 63 other aliases). There had been a few grumblings about the manner of our previous two defeats but as the Villagers gradually arrived, there was a positive feeling about this match. Maybe it was the warmth in the air; maybe it was the absence of Bomb&rsquo;s vast shadow; maybe the Villagers were looking forward to playing on a pitch that had been rolled rather than ploughed? Whatever the reason, there was a collective effort to approach this match in a relaxed but positive manner. </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">KP won the toss and the Informals were put into bat. Mav, remarkably having turned up sober and on time, opened the bowling at the Pavilion End with El Cap at the other. Considering the spongey qualities of the cricket ball, both men bowled very tight spells, highlighted by a superb instinctive caught and bowled from the Raef look-a-like. Rahat replaced the failed apprentice and then produced one of the most impressive debut spells in Village history (probably) with figures of 4-1-12-2. He began by clean bowling Harris, who was starting to look quite useful, and later sent Chapman back to the pavilion for a duck. Meanwhile Shoe Bomb came in for KP and bowled some pretty tight stuff before a couple of loose full tosses were dispatched past square leg by Carpmael, who until then had barely managed to get bat on ball. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">As Rahat continued to keep things tied down at one end, Doyle replaced Shoe Bomb at the other with a very useful spell of variation and pace. Potty, who had conceded a few more byes than usual having employed the 20-20 tactic of standing up to almost everything, was eventually rewarded with a fantastic reflex caught behind. Some sharp fielding from Thomas saw a &lsquo;very close&rsquo; run out chance turned down but Potty made up for this a few overs later by throwing down the stumps after Gill attempted a quick single.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Example then treated us to some typically exemplary bowling, completely bamboozling the batsmen for a few overs, but rather unluckily failed to pick up a wicket. Koder followed with a couple of slightly over-flighted deliveries which saw a catch, snaffled by the Captain of Chat at square leg, ruled out as a waist high no ball. After a discussion about what constituted a no ball and which umpire was allowed to call it, one would have expected Koder to pitch it a bit shorter. The Don, however, is not called The Don for nothing and continued his policy of flight until Gethin was clean-bowled by a full toss laser-guided at the top of the stumps. Meanwhile, batsman Milton produced a quick-fire 16, which suggested that the Informals should try him further up the order in future 20-20 fixtures. Mav was meant to be bowling the final over but a crocked elbow forced KP to make the slightly dubious call of bowling Marrow at the death. Fielders scattered to the boundaries and the standard pie chat ensued. The batsmen, however, were either deceived by the extreme lack of pace or over-pumped after all the baker-related comments and the anticipated carnage did not follow.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Informals clearly had some good batsmen but they seemed slightly undecided about whether to heave or nurdle. This, along with a strong all round performance in the field from the Village, kept the batting side to a total of 118, when 140-150 would probably be par for that wicket.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">After a quick turnaround, KP sent out Thomas and Lucarotti to open the batting. This Boycott-McCullum combo had a good look about it for a couple of overs but Thomas was bowled by Hull who angled in some difficult balls from round the wicket. Marrow joined MMJL, who was playing some classic Lucarotti strokes before a slower one from Milton was gifted to mid-off. Later the Village learnt that Lucarotti&rsquo;s hamstring was knacked and that he had in fact sacrificed his wicket for the cause - a model Villager. Pontin came in and played a few aggressive strokes, one of which Marrow was caught admiring while the other batsman tore up the wicket for a quick single. Recognising his fellow batsmen was playing the fool, Pontin did a rapid about turn and managed to return to his crease in time. Unfortunately one of Lumsden&rsquo;s balls then got a bit high on him and he could only guide a catch to gully.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Joining Marrow in the middle was Mav who seemed eager to show his batting credentials. While Marrow took some quick singles and the occasional four, Mav produced a swashbuckling display of big hitting, carting a few fours and sixes back over the bowler&rsquo;s head to the delight of the crowds in the pavilion. As the two Old Harrovians discussed port, debagging and communal showers, the light started to drop and eventually Marrow was out lbw to Chapman.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">By this stage the Village had got themselves back to a respectable position but KP&rsquo;s arrival at the crease put us well and truly ahead of the run rate. His 14 runs off the first three balls included a huge &lsquo;flick&rsquo; over mid-wicket for six, reminiscent of his namesake&rsquo;s flamingo. Doyle played some nice shots at the other end but KP was then bowled while attempting to blast a ball through Ally Pally&rsquo;s windows. Saul then came to the crease with a few useful swishes and the Village found themselves needing 2 runs off the last over. A nervous Village watched from the Pavilion, wondering which batsmen would take the bull by the horns, seize the moment, step up to the plate etc and so on. But having kept a low profile all day it was the quiet man, Frank Extras, who took the glory and guided us home with two rather anticlimactic byes.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">And so a happy Village settled down to some sandwiches and beers, merrily discussing life, the universe and everything. At one point someone noted Eklavya&rsquo;s absence but he was quickly spotted setting an example by simultaneously drinking, smoking and chatting on his mobile (presumably to Cameron Diaz or Bill Gates). Overall this was an enjoyable game at a lovely ground, played in the right spirit by both teams.</font></p>
