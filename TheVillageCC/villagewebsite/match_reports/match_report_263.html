Pubs close at eleven, The Office ran for just two seasons and The Avalanches only made one album. Likewise with the Village, whose STREAK was ended prematurely by Hobgoblin Nomads at Hilly Fields Park, with everyone left wondering what might have been. </span></p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">The day began in celebration, as KP was awarded his cap for his 100th Village appearance. He was looking forward to bowling, too. The council pitch was hard with a thick green top, but KP would have to wait as Troja won the toss and elected to bat. </span></p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">JDM and Pontin opened up, facing a left-arm-over Irishman from one end and a slow-left-arm (&ldquo;round and through&rdquo;, which caused Graham some confusion) from the other. They started okay, realising that there would be a few more threes than usual as shots that would usually go for four got stuck i</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cr1MvzAr26E" style="text-decoration:none;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(17, 85, 204); text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">n the long grass</span></a><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">. But a few overs in, JDM snicked off to the spinner and was brilliantly caught, one-handed, by the Hobgoblins skipper at slip. </span></p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">WLD came in at three and looked good, playing nicely through the covers, but chopped on to the spinner. There was a bowling change at the other end and the Louse-esque John came on, with disastrous consequences for Village hopes of getting a big score. Bilal &ndash;&nbsp;in at four &ndash;&nbsp;went LBW (not without some Boa-related umpiring controversy), and Pontin was caught just above the turf (not without Pitch giving it out from square leg). John also bowled debutant Ollie Ball to leave the Village reeling. </span></p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">KP smited a huge four before getting out soon afterwards playing a very similar shot, before Tommo became John&rsquo;s fifth scalp, uncharacteristically playing all around one. TDM came in at nine to join captain Troja and the pair built the first significant partnership of the innings, running twos and picking up singles to get the Village to (if memory serves) seventy-odd for seven at drinks. </span></p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">But TDM got his leg stump clipped soon after drinks, breaking up what looked like being a game-saving partnership, with Pitch coming in at ten. The next few overs saw some great strike-keeping, with Troja picking up the runs and Pitcher managing to keep them out. But Pitch got his eye in and stopped needing to be protected, smacking a couple of big blows. But soon after Troja reached 50, and John came back into the attack, he was caught for 12 and Boa went soon after for John&rsquo;s seven-for. </span></p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">1st innings: VCC 137 all out (35 overs)</span></p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">&lt;teachat&gt; Spread of the season. Hobgoblins&rsquo; artisanal WAGs pulled out all the stops, with sandwich ingredients including: halved cherry tomatoes, avocado, spring onion and pesto. Tuna and sweetcorn in fresh baguettes, egg and spinach on thickly sliced wholemeal, plenty of chicken: superb. If this is what the gentrification of Brockley means, bring it on. We&rsquo;ll be back next year. VCC WAGs take note.&lt;/teachat&gt;</span></p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">Suitably refreshed and filled (WLD planted his feet firmly at gully), the Village took to the field knowing they could give things a good go if they started well and put the pressure on from the off. Tommo opened up with Matty Boa, sitting on 98 wickets for the club. They started brilliantly &ndash;&nbsp;the first three overs were all maidens &ndash;&nbsp;before Boa went to 99, pinning one of the openers on the foot for an LBW. </span></p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">Tommo then got the Hobgoblins skipper, with WLD catching sharply at gully. Something even better came soon after &ndash;&nbsp;the other opener was cleaned up by a Tommo jaffer, the ball starting off down leg (so much so that the keeper&rsquo;s feet were already moving to take it down the leg side) before swinging back to hit middle-and-off. The Village were euphoric, but knew that the next bat, Taylor, was decent and had got 70 last season. He stamped his credentials by dispatching Tommo for four over extra cover soon after coming in. </span></p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">But cometh the hour, cometh Boa, who brought up his Village century with a booming inswinger that got between Taylor&rsquo;s bat and pad. The legendary Kiwi got a round of applause from his teammates as they awaited the next bat. Before being replaced by KP at his end, Boa picked up a third thanks to a good catch from Balil at mid-on. </span></p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">TDM had come on for Tommo from the top, and consistently beat the bat, keeping things tight. At the other end, KP had opened his box of tricks and was giving Hobgoblins&rsquo; sixth wicket his whole repertoire. But the wicket just wouldn&rsquo;t come, with both batsmen surviving by the skin of their teeth. </span></p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">Hobgoblins were still way behind the rate, but the longer KP and TDM bowled without taking wickets, the more difficult things got. Boa was bowled out, Tommo had a couple left. TDM&rsquo;s overs ran out &ndash;&nbsp;tight but wicketless. KP picked up one &ndash;&nbsp;skied to Morgan in the gully, but a shout to the scorers found that he, too, had bowled his full eight. After the match, the Village saw he&rsquo;d only bowled seven. There was no suggestion of foul play, but it was costly. </span></p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">Troja and Pitcher, who came on, just couldn&rsquo;t keep the runs down like the pacemen could. Boundaries started to come, keeping Hobgoblins in touching distance when they&rsquo;d once been something like 30&ndash;5. One of the game&rsquo;s champagne moments, though, came in Troja&rsquo;s spell, when Pontin at wide mid-on, covered some serious ground to take a great catch, receiving applause from spectators on the bank. Pitcher also picked up a wicket, stumped. </span></p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">White, the Irish opening bowler, rode his luck a little (two Village chances off him went down, Troja into the sun at cover and Bilal above his head at mid-on) but hit the ball cleanly and didn&rsquo;t show any nerves. With three overs left, Hobgoblins needed 19 &ndash;&nbsp;13 came off it. The Village had the chance to win and put the game to bed, but the STREAK died in Brockley. Long live the STREAK. </span></p>
<br />
<span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">This was all then discussed at great length in the pub, until closing (with apologies to Marie). </span></span></p>
