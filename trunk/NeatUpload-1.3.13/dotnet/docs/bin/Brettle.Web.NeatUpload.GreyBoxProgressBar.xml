            <summary>
            Displays progress and status of an upload using a GreyBox pop-up window.</summary>
            <remarks>
            For the progress bar to be displayed, the <see cref="T:Brettle.Web.NeatUpload.UploadHttpModule" /> must be in use.
            For the progress display to be started, the form being submitted must include an <see cref="T:Brettle.Web.NeatUpload.InputFile" />
            control that is not empty.  If you use the <see cref="P:Brettle.Web.NeatUpload.GreyBoxProgressBar.Triggers" /> property (or the <see cref="M:Brettle.Web.NeatUpload.GreyBoxProgressBar.AddTrigger(System.Web.UI.Control)" /> method)
            to specify which controls should cause files to be uploaded, then other controls will not start the progress
            display (e.g. "Cancel" buttons).
