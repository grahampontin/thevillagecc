<p><font face="Arial">You might have thought that with one batsman hitting an unbeaten 50 and two bowlers taking a combined 5-59 that the Village CC would have emerged victorious from this game. But this is the Village we're talking about, and you all know better than that.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The omens were there from the very start, as Nick 'flatmate-of-Saul-or-is-it-actually-Ed' pulled up on his bike and then fell over, while stationary. Remarkable.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Fresh from a resounding (and uplifting) victory over arch-rivals London Fields, there was real hope that a victory against Coach would re-invigorate the Village's league title ambitions. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Another toss was lost, and the collected 11 of the Village took to the field yet again (nobody can remember the last time the green and whites set a total). And the momentum from the Fields game was obvious, as Richardson removed both openers during a quite brilliant opening spell with figures of 2-16.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">It should be noted, at this point, that several Villagers had opted to join an unsanctioned rebel tour to the south west. As monsoon conditions hurtled them about the coast, loyal Villagers enjoyed glorious sunshine at the picturesque Fortress Springfield.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Wickets continued to fall and the run-rate was under control. Brendan had the number three caught behind, while Woodhouse snared Siddique with a rank wide delivery which the batsman only succeeded in chipping up towards Richardson. The big man let it slip through his hands, bounced it off both pecs and then finally took the catch, clearly showboating for the crowd gathered for a birthday party in the bandstand.</font></p>

At drinks, all was looking up for the Village. But talismanic Coach captain John Schnadhorst was at the crease, and looking in decent nick. And in a brilliantly measured innings, hit an unbeaten half-century as he and the middle order opened their shoulders.</p>
<p>Pontin came on and took a three-for as the batsmen became more expansive, and Bowman popped up with a late lbw but by then the damage was done &ndash; 195 was around 30 over par, making Frank Extras' 45 particularly important.</p>
<p>Village tails were up. 195 looked chaseable, though the boundaries were long. Sam and Ed made a watchful start, before the latter was bowled by the energetic Mo. That brought Pontin to the crease, and having been freed from his wicket keeping duties for the day clearly had his eye on the man of the match award and set upon his way to an impressive 36, eventually caught and bowled by James.</p>
<p>(At about this time, non-batting Villagers had to tackle a fire on the boundary. An indication of how tinder-box dry the conditions were in comparison to Cornwall.)</p>
<p>Luca made a solitary run before being removed by Sultan, Rahilly hit a four and then departed, and Bowman &ndash; still struggling with a sore ankle &ndash; managed six. But Dan Plimmer was still at the crease and looking very good. The run-rate was creeping up, but in league with Brendan (12), Village were still in with a mathematical shout. </p>
<p>Once Brendan was out, it fell to Richardson (6*) and Plimmer (62*, nine fours) to try to get their side over the line. It was a valiant effort, but eventually too much of an ask as the Village managed only 173.</p>
<p>They say that winning isn't everything, and that was the general lesson to take from this match. Everyone enjoyed what was an excellent game of cricket.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Man of the match is a tough one. Potty's 3-43 and 36 was impressive, but Dan Plimmer's unbeaten knock &ndash; combined with some excellent keeping &ndash; probably just edges it.</p>
<p>As for Village idiot, it's hard to see past Nick's pre-match fall. Unlucky, Flute.</p>
