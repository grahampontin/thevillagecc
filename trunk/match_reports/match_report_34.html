<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">There are some sporting fixtures so legendary that the mere mention of them causes the enthusiast&rsquo;s pulse to quicken and the imagination to run riot. <st1:country-region w:st="on">Australia</st1:country-region> against <st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region> at Lord&rsquo;s, for example, or <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Barcelona</st1:city></st1:place> v. Real Madrid at the Nou Camp. To that illustrious pantheon, we can now add The Village CC v. London Fields at London Fields.<o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">The latest clash of the cricketing titans, the first of the 2007 season, was due to take place on Saturday. Ever since the fixture list had been announced, all the talk had been of this match, the first chance for reigning champions London Fields to put the young pretenders from The Village in their place, and for the insurgents to stake their claim for a first-ever NELCL title. Neutrals were frustrated, then, when the days leading up to the game were wet and stormy, raising the prospect that the match would have to be called off.<o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Saturday morning dawned showery but, after a late pitch inspection by the LF captain, it was official: the game was on. It was a relief for VCC captain Pontin, who was desperate to unleash a strong and hungry XI on the title-holders. With Antipodean all-rounder Toby Strobes available once again and a bowling line-up featuring Kiwi Paul, Maj and the devious Maverick DI, the wily Scot was eager to win his first toss of 2007 and put London Fields in on the archetypal sticky wicket.<o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">It was not too be, however. The luckless Pontin lost again, activating a clause in the VCC constitution which stipulates that Texas Damon Wake, the Brum-based Botham, is now the club&rsquo;s official tosser (his status as tosser having been unofficial until now). Unsurprisingly, the Fields captain inserted the Village. As if that were not setback enough, things were about to get worse.<o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Strobes, last year&rsquo;s player of the season, had been pencilled in to open the batting. With game-time fast approaching, however, he was nowhere to be found. It was revealed through a series of phone calls that he had an unspecified &lsquo;appointment&rsquo; at 2 o&rsquo;clock and would miss the start of the match. Without an opener and with concerns about the state of the pitch growing, the Village turned its lonely eyes to Hom.<o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Missing all last season due to injuries sustained in a bizarre gardening accident, Ed T. Hom-Ass strapped on his pads and accompanied his glorious leader out to the middle, the support of the rest of the team, pint-sized supporter Mini-Maj and assorted Wags ringing in their ears. Their tenure at the crease would not be long, but it would be glorious.<o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Pontin bravely faced the first delivery, Fields deviously employing a left=arm seam bowler from the Park End. The opening delivery rapped the Village skipper hard on the thigh pad. The game was on. With the ball swinging in to the right hander and the bounce uneven, batting was difficult. The Village eventually got off the mark from the fifth delivery, which flicked GCP&rsquo;s pad and was fumbled by the wicket-keeper, allowing the batsmen to scramble a single. Amazingly, despite the fact that there had been some distance between Pontin&rsquo;s bat and the ball, umpire DI didn&rsquo;t single a leg-bye. Later, during the post-mortem in the pub, Mav was questioned about this and insisted that Graham had hit the ball. &ldquo;So what would have happened if the keeper had caught it and the oppo had appealed?&rdquo; asked the assembled Villagers, aghast. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d have given him out,&rdquo; replied the (hopefully) former umpire.<o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">With Thomas seeing out the last ball of the over, it was time to see what else the champions had up their sleeve. It turned out to be another left-arm seam bowler, a piece of chicanery that clearly contravened not only the Spirit of Cricket, but also rule 25.6, paragraph 24 of the Rules of Cricket: &ldquo;Though shalt not open the bowling with two left-armers, as the oppo will not be able to hit them and this will constitute an unfair advantage.&rdquo; <o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">But the two teams had more pressing matters on their mind &ndash; it had started to rain. The over began, but it soon became apparent that this was more than a shower. The two teams trooped off, seconds before a cloudburst finished off any lingering hopes of more play. The two teams of gladiators trooped off, reluctantly but resolutely, to the warm environs of the Pub On The Park, there to discuss in-depth the 7 balls that had been bowled. In a fixture like this, so full of intrigue and tension, each ball is weighted with meaning. This occasion, despite its brevity, was no different. There were issues aplenty to debate: why do we let Mav umpire? Will Damon be a better (or bigger) tosser than Graham? And what the hell happened to Strobes?<o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>
