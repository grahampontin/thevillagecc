<p class="MsoNormal">1.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Oriel&rsquo;s ground, the hallow&rsquo;d place is found</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In Oxford, a little way off Cowley Road</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In days of yore, &lsquo;twas Marrow&rsquo;s batting ground</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The maidens would coo, when out to bat he strode</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Beautifully, to all parts, the ball he&rsquo;d pound</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And soon, the bowlers&rsquo; confidence implode</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Village, then, wished him at Bartlemas</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But they were alone, bereft &ndash; Marrowless.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Skipper Bowman walked out to the wicket</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A tough choice the cap&rsquo;n faced, for the pitch</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Was wet and green, not for flashy cricket</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To bat or bowl &ndash; he knew &lsquo;twas a choice which</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Would, if made right, be just the ticket</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">No head in sand: this Kiwi no ostrich.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The coin went up, and down it came; to bat</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">His call: we&rsquo;d guts it out, and that was that.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">3.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He walked out to open the innings with White,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Runs he foresaw &ndash; the southpaw was in form.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The first overs were cagey; the bowlers were tight</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And above our heroes, a gathering storm</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Which made the ball swing and dip in its flight</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">They battled hard; the skipper&rsquo;s mind did swarm</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He went for a drive, but the stroke was wild &ndash;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He&rsquo;s gone! Out, departed: caught by a child.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">4.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It meant that a prodigal son returned</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Could he get our innings back on the rails?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Was the man to make the runs we yearned</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Paul Collingwood lookalike Ed Hayles?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He started badly, and looked quite concerned</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He took us to lunch &ndash; I&rsquo;ll spare the details</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Suffice to say, such sessions win matches</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Edward was helped out by two dropped catches.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">5.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Meanwhile, in the pavilion&rsquo;s embrace</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Another drama was unfolding due</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To David Ireland who, with such good grace</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Had some brand new WAGs managed to accrue</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Said one Villager, &ldquo;I must press my case</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Upon these ladies making their debut.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A phenomenon hard to catch in rhyme</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What else to write, but that it was Lousetime?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">6.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Said Ed, &ldquo;Sod this, I&rsquo;ve not batted in years</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Balls to this blocking &ndash; it&rsquo;s time to attack&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So after lunch to rousing Village cheers</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He and Bomb went out, and gave it a thwack.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">They tonked the bowling, these two cavaliers</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It meant the fielders were forced to fall back.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Freed from technical penitentiaries</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Both brave batsmen reached their half centuries.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">7.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">They carried on swinging &ndash; they scored and scored</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But batting in this manner, it means</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You live as you perish &ndash; by the sword</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The oppo&rsquo;s child knew his fielding routines</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Thanks to his catches &ndash; advantage restored.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Out in the pavilion our team convenes</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;We need 200 plus &ndash; it can&rsquo;t be ignored</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We need a guy to (say the men of Queens)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As Tony Greig would say &ndash;&lsquo;Come to the party&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Step forward our Aussie &ndash; Stephen Harty.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">8.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The antipodean made a good score</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And now it fell to a Cumbrian loon</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">With a brand new ball, to open the door</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He bowled full and straight, the Sedbergh Typhoon</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We all were gripped by an esprit de corps</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As Stevo made them dance to his tune.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And sure could he take his wickets no cheaper</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Lo! He&rsquo;s only trapped the Blues&rsquo; wicket keeper!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">9.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;Come on boys, a wicket brings one more,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Called out a fielder, as a child walked out.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The umpire, his father, began he to roar</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Accused us of sledging, started to shout.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">His own team mates found him a crashing bore</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It needed someone to inform this lout:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;The problem, dear father competitive</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Your hectoring soon grows rather repetitive.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">10.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Things got worse, for your bard stepped up to bowl</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And didn&rsquo;t want to unleash a screamer</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Trying to bowl slowly, he lost all control</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;Oh Christ,&rdquo; all thought, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s let slip a beamer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I&rsquo;d achieved the opposite of my goal</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The umpire started to hiss like a steamer</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The child was made of sterner stuff than his dad:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He hooked it for four &ndash; even I was glad.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">11</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Three overs left &ndash; three results on the cards</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But the batsman slow-scoring, like A. Strauss</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The chance of a win, he now disregards</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Great bowling from Bowman, Harty and Louse.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ireland couldn&rsquo;t break through &ndash; doorknob/retards</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(A Dodgeball quote), so to a public house</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Awards &ndash; Stevo MOM, and now I&rsquo;m a riddler.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Idiot goes to a vain diddler.</p>
