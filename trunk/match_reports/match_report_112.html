<conditions><p>Sunny. Pitch hadn't been mowed but still relatively even, if very slow indeed. Chain-wielding maniacs conspicuous by their absence.</p> </conditions><p>When it comes to underachievement, cricket can be the most beguiling game of all. Mark Ramprakash's Test career. Mohammad Sami's bowling average. England's refusal to pick people who can actually play One Day Cricket. The list goes on, and somewhere near the top must be The Village's record against London Fields. If ever there was a bogey fixture, it's this one. Over the years, we've beaten them three times (I think), which isn't too bad considering that, on the whole, they're a better team than us. </p>
<p>But the losses. Oh, the losses. When we've underperformed, we haven't just let ourselves down slightly: instead the wheels have come off in a quite remarkable manner. Last year two of our best bowlers went at 10 runs an over for the duration of their spells and our reply, when batting, saw a relatively strong line up capitulate to 35 all out. Why? Their batting is very good, but not as strong as some teams we play, and their bowling is nagging and skilful but far from terrifying.</p>
<p>It's a mystery. Let's describe this latest shocker, and try to make some sense of the madness. We arrived at their home ground to find an underprepared pitch: it seems Hackney council are only slightly better than Haringey in their care of cricket wickets. To make things worse, we lost the toss and had to bat. Nevertheless, this shouldn't have been a cause for concern. After all, we've played 8 games on the Rec this season. And we were a side with some confidence - the previous week we'd very narrowly failed to chase down a testing Strong Room target on another dificult wicket.</p>
<p>So off we went. And in no time at all Potty and Morgs were back in the hutch, Potty playing too early at a ball that didn't come on, Morgs missing a straight one. It was good bowling, but it was bad batting. At the other end, Steve Harty was playing an absolute blinder - rather than working the ball around, he settled on blocking and then lashing the occasional boundary - one six over cover was an incredible repeat of a shot he played last week. Marrow joined him, and instantly looked solid, adding 50 with very little trouble. </p>
<p>Then disaster struck. Harty received a slow full toss, attempted to smack it for six, and was plumb. Still, a decent score on the board and plenty of batting to come - the Village were eyeing up 200 + without too much trouble. Your correspondent came in, received a wide and high full toss, and drove it to mid-off. Terrible, terrible batting again. In fact, a feature of the innings was that no one could say they got an unplayable ball, but several people certainly got out to bad ones.</p>
<p>Even after that, we were still in a position to make a decent score. Sabi came in, struck some elegant boundaries through third man, then popped up a catch. MMJ missed a straight one first up. What made this so frustrating was that at the other end Marrow was playing perfectly for the situation - we simply needed one person to stay there for 6 or 7 overs and we'd have been well on track. </p>
<p>It wasn't to be. Eklavya chipped up a caught and bowled, KP swung across a straight one, and Louse and Eddie found themselves caught up in a comical run out. Innings over. Dave Hickie had bowled some accurate left arm spin and taken 3-17. It wasn't the sort of bowling that should run through a side, but it was, like the rest of the bowling - consistently accurate, and with a line up that seemed determined to shoot itself in the foot at every opportunity, it was all that was needed.</p>
<p>Things got much, much worse when we went out to field. We knew we were short - we had no scoreboard pressure at all, so we had to bowl wicket-taking balls. Truth be told KP bowled well and your correspondent didn't do too badly filling in the opening bowler's role, but the absolute shocker continued: the fielding was absolutely abysmal (I think I conceded 4 boundaries in misfields) and the batsmen could happily leave alone anything they didn't want to play.</p>
<p>The game was pretty much up by the time our change bowlers came on - while Eklavya continued to bowl very well indeed and Steve Harty did a job, the Village knew they'd blown it. Fields romped to the win thanks to a very nicely-played innings from their wicketkeeper, and we'd pulled out our absolute worst performance - by a mile - to finish the season.</p>
<p>Are there any positives to take from it? Well, maybe. For a start, most of us were livid at the performance we'd pulled out, and that's a sign of our improvement. It's been a decent season in terms of results, so it was a shame to see us regress to the level we were at a couple of years ago. Marrow and Steve confirmed - as if it was needed - that they're both very solid batsmen. Eklavya has regained his bowling mojo. </p>
<p>But on the whole, it was a downbeat end to the season, and the only highlight were the beers with the oppo after the game. The next day, your correspondent played his final game of the season for another club on a bitch of a pitch against probably a better attack, and hit 50. Why had it all gone wrong the day before? As so often when we play at Fields, it's a complete mystery.</p>
