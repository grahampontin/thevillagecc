<p>1. Suffering from hangovers, we arrived at the pub for some pies. Except in PRAP!s case, for those present decided that a potato and cheese pie is in fact not a pie, but a lidded quiche. Cue new nickname for our sometime wicketkeeper.</p>
<p>2. Rain pouring and a powerful wind blowing across the ground, and not just from our arses since we'd discovered that the pub was open and was selling yet more rot gut. We decided to go ahead, despite the pitch having the consistency of a chocolate mousse. Which incidentally, some of us had eaten as the waiting staff had brought one out with a candle (me neither) for Graham. Happy Birthday Tinpot.</p>
<p>3. Richie and Rahilly opened and soon both of them had their shit ruined, quite possibly in a deliberate effort to get back into the special bus and the warm.</p>
<p>4. Sam MacDonald next in and accordingly the sun suddenly came out. He hit some quite glorious shots for his 38 and lost the ball after one huge six cleared the car park. Needless to say the rain and wind soon returned. It might have been the cricketing gods' anger due to The Lidded Quiche failing to get the ball off the square at the other end. He started to find the middle of his bat, then promptly got bowled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. KP came in, hit a couple of sixes and then tried the switch hit, missed and was given LBW by me. I swear it was out, but I'd had about 3 pints of scrumpy at this stage in an attempt to keep warm so it might have been a wide for all I know. Sod him, he shouldn't have tried to be such a clever dick.</p>
<p>6. Mid innings break. I had Marrow's rather fetching cagoul at this stage and was far happier with my lot. Francis bowled accurately for no reward, Richardson skidded some quick balls through off a short run and soon the Griffin were struggling. Marcus I Love Fielding dropped another catch as is his way after a big night, but fortunately it was off the Louse so everyone felt a bit better. Graham kept worse than a badly-placed boundary flag, but in his defence the wicket was by now a peat bog. As if to signify that that was enough shite cricket for one day the skies truly opened and we all hid in the town hall and had a rather excellent tea. Shortly after game over, and so to London, most of us with crashing hangovers. Cracking weekend all in all, as usual finishing with rain and a valiant attempt to play cricket. Thanks be to Alex Page.</p>
