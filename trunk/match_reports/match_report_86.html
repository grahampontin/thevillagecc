So the season began at Wray Crescent, a ground we'd never played at before. Upon our arrival, we began to realise why. Three things stood out. <br />
<ol>
    <li>The ground was very small indeed. <br />
    </li>
    <li>The pitch was astroturf. <br />
    </li>
    <li>There were a selection of burly flat footed sloggers awaiting our arrival and licking their lips for some reason.</li>
</ol>
I'm not sure there's much point going on: KP did an admirable job with the new ball to the extent that at one point someone missed it and even more unluckily got bowled. After that it was a case of retrieving the ball from various areas of North London. Eklavya, our new recruit, looked a class act with his off spin, but even he couldn't keep the batsmen in check. <br />
<br />
It would be remiss not to mention the fact that your brave author also had his shit ruined. Two wickets for Mr Koder, who bowled well, and one for P-Ly, who might have taken five on a different day. One also for a deeply hungover Mav, who might also have taken five on a different day, against a different opposition, and on a different pitch.<br />
<br />
Onto our innings, and a run rate of something like 7 an over was always going to be a bit of a struggle. Without wishing to accuse the opposition of cynicism in any way, they did only have one proper bowler, and he was 15. He did play for Surrey and run in from the boundary however, and he did remove your author, who will probably go to his grave swearing he got a nick on what turned out to be a successful lbw appeal (thanks Mav), and that was about it really. <br />
<br />
Most other batsmen perished to their slowest and crappest bowler, usually for about 20 odd, and usually attempting to smack sixes in a bid to chase the huge total (special mention to KP for smashing a huge one into a nearby house), and we all went off to the pub to mutter about wanting to play on grass and how it was all just an extended net.<br />
<br />
Except for Mav, who'd left early to chase some tail. I don't think I need to say who gets Village Idiot.<br />
