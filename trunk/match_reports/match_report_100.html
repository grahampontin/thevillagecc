<div><strong>The Village vs Queens&rsquo; College </strong>(with muttered apologies to Alexander Pope/William McGonagall)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Prologue</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To Cambridge, Villagers! And to the scene</div>
<div>Where <i>Sportsmen</i>, <i>Rakes</i> and famed <i>Queensmen</i> of yore</div>
<div>Have eked out on the sumptuous, boundless green</div>
<div>Five hundred years in <i>Win</i>, vile <i>Loss</i> and boring <i>Draw</i>.</div>
<div>The outfield&rsquo;s flat, the pitch a trampoline,</div>
<div>Which promises, at least, a decent score.</div>
<div>Brush whites and polish boots. Your thigh-guard smarten:</div>
<div>Today&rsquo;s duel takes place on the <i>Road</i> <i>to</i> <i>Barton</i>.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A more illustrious bunch you could not ask</div>
<div>Of <i>Predators</i>, <i>Commandos</i> and <i>Top Guns</i></div>
<div>As climbed aboard the <i>Chat Express</i> to bask</div>
<div>In one another&rsquo;s brilliant cultural Suns.</div>
<div>Their shock was prick&rsquo;d when <i>Banter</i> did unmask</div>
<div>The man with Tenerife&rsquo;s most supple buns</div>
<div>As boasting a &ldquo;Films Seen&rdquo; total of three -</div>
<div><i>Louse</i> grew up on The Isle of No TV.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><i>or</i></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As having seen less* films than Stevie Wonder</div>
<div>Childhood in Tenerife the <i>Louse&rsquo;s</i> blunder.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>* &ldquo;Fewer&rdquo; (&ldquo;Andy&rdquo;)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>II</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But when th&rsquo;<i>Express</i> poured out its happy throng</div>
<div>And cars and bikes had pulled up to the ground,</div>
<div>The roll of <i>Village Heroes</i> was as long</div>
<div>As <i>Andy Richardson</i>&rsquo;s belly is round:</div>
<div><i>Potty, Bomb, Luca, Marrow, Hanson</i>: Strong.</div>
<div>Then <i>Bowman</i>, <i>Ireland</i><i>, Lyneham</i>, a list crowned</div>
<div>By <i>Louse</i>. Show him a maid, and he&rsquo;ll aboard her</div>
<div>But comes last in the Village batting order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>III</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>And what of <i>Richardson</i>? And what of <i>Queens</i>?</div>
<div>The Deities had intertwined their fate.</div>
<div>Since half the oppo&rsquo;s band of fresh-faced teens</div>
<div>Had buggered off to <i>Wembley</i> to watch Leight-</div>
<div>On Baines or some such Chav-baller, it means</div>
<div>That <i>Andy</i> played for them, and with the great</div>
<div>Man in the foes&rsquo; ranks was a fabled Sage</div>
<div>Who studies insects from another age,</div>
<div>Who&rsquo;s often known in sophistry t&rsquo;engage,</div>
<div>Who thinks beer as a <i>Sports Drink&rsquo;s</i> all the rage,</div>
<div>I speak, of course, of <i>Alexander Page.</i></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>IV</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>At this point let the critics note to boot,</div>
<div>That while some have waxed scornful at his timing,</div>
<div>The <i>Mav&rsquo;rick</i>, having telephoned <i>en route</i>,</div>
<div>From on the M-11 (prompting miming</div>
<div>Among cynics who mouthed &ldquo;Junction One&rdquo; imput-</div>
<div>ing that he might be late), Was There! Though I&rsquo;m in-</div>
<div>clined to think it likely owed as much</div>
<div>To straight line speed as <i>ETD</i>s as such.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>V</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><i>Qu&rsquo;importe!</i> The game was on. The captains tossed.</div>
<div>The <i>Queens</i><i>&rsquo;</i> won and they chose to take the field.</div>
<div>Perhaps here the initiative was lost.</div>
<div>Flat pitch and carpet-outfield fain appealed</div>
<div>To the intrepid student sportsmen, bossed,</div>
<div>Perchance by older <i>Andiumus&hellip; </i>Concealed</div>
<div>The <i>Northern Pedant</i> a desire</div>
<div>To snuff the light of old friend <i>Potty&rsquo;s</i> fire?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>VI</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><i>Potty</i> it was strode out at Barton Road</div>
<div>Along with <i>White</i>, a seldom nippy scorer.</div>
<div>And so the ever-wary <i>Tartan Toad</i></div>
<div>Hopped on in nurdled prods, with just one fourer.</div>
<div>His colleague, too, obeyed the <i>Spartan Code</i></div>
<div>And made the partnership a hellish borer.</div>
<div>Although it must be said that <i>Andy&rsquo;s</i> bowling</div>
<div>Was like his chat: fast, fiery and cajoling.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>VII</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The crowd were combatting the need to sleep</div>
<div>They felt that something drastic must be done</div>
<div>For tho&rsquo; blue sky and batting order deep</div>
<div>Meant time was on their side, they knew the Sun</div>
<div>Shines but eight hours in Spring and keep</div>
<div>-ing these two <i>Dullards</i> at the crease weren&rsquo;t fun.</div>
<div>And so the <i>Umpire&rsquo;s</i> coat went straight to <i>Pete</i></div>
<div>An effort both the <i>Snail-Bats</i> to unseat.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>VIII</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&lsquo;Twas without cause, for barely had <i>P-Ly</i></div>
<div>Assumed his place at <i>Square Leg</i> than a ball</div>
<div>From <i>Andimus</i> came ricocheting by.</div>
<div>The bowler&rsquo;s outstretched hands answered the call</div>
<div>And <i>Graham&rsquo;s </i>innings&rsquo; end &ndash; thank God &ndash; was nigh.</div>
<div>Despite the paltry sum of runs he&rsquo;d got he</div>
<div>Felt sure more joy would come from <i>Lucarotti</i></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>IX</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But wait! Another battle must play out</div>
<div>&lsquo;Twixt <i>Pete&rsquo;s</i> pugnacious <i>Ump</i> and <i>Boring</i> <i>Bomb</i></div>
<div>Who, usually impervious to doubt,</div>
<div>Began to be undone by <i>Lyneham&rsquo;s</i> dom-</div>
<div>inating chat and japes. <i>Pete</i> lay about</div>
<div>Like he was sleeping, but his brilliant <i>Zom-</i></div>
<div><i>bie Walk</i> from square leg to the wicket</div>
<div>did for <i>A White</i> but did wonders for cricket.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>X</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The track at <i>Barton Road</i> is made for edges</div>
<div>The sort of place where <i>Proper Cricket&rsquo;s</i> played</div>
<div>A lesser <i>Lords</i>, hem&rsquo;d not with Stands but Hedges -</div>
<div>But Straight-Bat Standard isn&rsquo;t <i>Luca&rsquo;s</i> trade</div>
<div>He&rsquo;d rather launch <i>Five Irons</i> and <i>Sand Wedges</i></div>
<div>And this he did with quick strokes of the blade</div>
<div>He even tried some lovely cover drives</div>
<div>But perished, bowled by <i>Cork</i><i>,</i> and out of lives.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>XI</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><i>Bomb</i> often claims the love of one <i>Fran Bell</i></div>
<div>A lovelier Physician you&rsquo;ll not see.</div>
<div>But though this ruse seems to fit <i>Alan</i> well</div>
<div>The <i>Village</i> wags (not <i>WAGs</i>) would disagree:</div>
<div>They know whose face prompts <i>Mini-Bomb</i> to swell,</div>
<div>Whose glance can make him have to make &lsquo;<i>Love Wee&rsquo;.</i></div>
<div>Nought ever flew as straight as <i>Cupid&rsquo;s</i> Arrow</div>
<div>When to the heart of <i>Bomb</i> it pinned the <i>Marrow.</i></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>XII</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>And so up to the crease steps <i>Marcus Littlejohns</i></div>
<div>To face the pies of <i>Singh, Radford and Chew.</i></div>
<div>The bowlers try but their spirits are brittle ones</div>
<div>While <i>Marcus&rsquo;</i> has the strength of bended Yew.</div>
<div>And though the looping balls are bound to skittle ones</div>
<div>With lesser backbone, <i>Marrow </i>just chugs through</div>
<div>Much like he would when downing pints of <i>Beverage</i> -</div>
<div>It&rsquo;s almost like he&rsquo;s playing for his <i>Average</i>.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>XIII</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The time grows short &ndash; I&rsquo;ll make the story blunt</div>
<div>And skip fast down the order: next in&rsquo;s <i>Parp</i></div>
<div>Who blocks a few and then gets trapped in front</div>
<div>He wasn&rsquo;t quick enough to dodge a sharp-</div>
<div>ish one from <i>Singh.</i> Next up the Kiwi count-</div>
<div>ryman of <i>Conchords&rsquo;</i> <i>Murray</i>, <i>KP,</i> scarp</div>
<div>ering for runs. But Marrow opts to send</div>
<div>Him back &ndash; he&rsquo;s run out at the other end.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>XIV</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There comes a time in life when we should judge</div>
<div>A man not by his face or friends but acts.</div>
<div>This time had come for <i>Marrow</i>. O the fudge</div>
<div>He made of running out <i>DI</i> detracts</div>
<div>Much from his stock. He straight refused to budge:</div>
<div>Down on the plucky <i>Mav&rsquo;rick</i> fell the axe.</div>
<div>There ends the innings. <i>Lyneham</i> did not score</div>
<div>As <i>Marcus</i> hogged strike like a batting whore.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>XV</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The innings over, <i>Village</i> turned to bowling</div>
<div>Conditions never were as good as these.</div>
<div>If <i>P-Ly</i>&rsquo;dhad a bell, it would be tolling</div>
<div>To tell the coming deaths of the Q.C.s.</div>
<div>His first one was a duck, with <i>Belford </i>holing</div>
<div>Out to <i>Moderate</i> <i>Marcus </i>in the breeze.</div>
<div>He was trailed shortly by his next supporter</div>
<div>Caught <i>lb</i> by a true <i>Lyneham</i> <i>Ripsnorter.</i></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>XVI</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><i>Cork</i>went to <i>Bowman</i> flummoxed on nineteen,</div>
<div>Then came a moment of mix&rsquo;d Joy and Woe.</div>
<div><i>Louse</i> bowled, bat slogged, the looping ball was seen -</div>
<div>By all except the fielder, <i>Parp</i>, whose slow</div>
<div>attempt to catch it failed. The ball careen-</div>
<div>ed away to <i>Lyneham</i>, master of the throw.</div>
<div>His run-out truly was a thing of wonder.</div>
<div><i>The Louse</i> looked on with eyes like <i>Days of Thunder</i>.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>XVII</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There&rsquo;s little more to tell of this encounter</div>
<div>Tho&rsquo; <i>Page</i> and <i>Andy</i> fought to stem the tide,</div>
<div><i>The Village</i> rolled the <i>Queen</i> and made to mount her</div>
<div>And ride her back a sad, defeated side.</div>
<div>And while <i>Runs Scored</i> made but a poor amount, her</div>
<div>Chaste <i>Modesty</i> was salvaged by her pride</div>
<div>As well as <i>Extras</i>, <i>Queensmens&rsquo;</i> highest scorer</div>
<div>And general player-dignity-restorer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>XVIII</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What dire defence from vigilant causes springs!</div>
<div>The <i>Village Idiot</i> goes to both the <i>Openers</i>.</div>
<div>What mighty wickets rise from rapid flings!</div>
<div><i>Man of the Match</i> is <i>Lyneham&rsquo;s</i> for his dope blurs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Epilogue</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>From here the action moves to <i>Drinks</i> and <i>Dancing</i></div>
<div>Which carried on and on into the night</div>
<div>It takes in <i>Luca&rsquo;s</i> pants and <i>Louse&rsquo;s</i> prancing</div>
<div>As well as <i>Horses</i> laughing with delight</div>
<div>At rubbish jokes. <i>Bomb&rsquo;s</i> puppetry, entrancing</div>
<div>Though it was, gave <i>Mav</i> <i>Felatio</i>-based fright&hellip;</div>
<div>But these, alas, are tales for other ears</div>
<div>To be retold again adown the years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The End - (although I might be persuaded to write one about the the evening)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
