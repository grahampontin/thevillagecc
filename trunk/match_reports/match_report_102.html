<div>Albert Recreation Ground</div>
<div>4.35pm</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Dearest Sergio,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Very sorry you can&rsquo;t be here today. You know that it&rsquo;s never the same without you. We&rsquo;re about halfway through the game as I write this. It&rsquo;s been very exciting thus far. Let me tell you about what I have seen and then if there is time I can discuss Olly in greater detail.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The day started with me being unleashed from the club bag and clumsily thrust into the track here at the Albert Recreation Ground. Now Sergio, you know very well that I have been inserted into a great variety of places but I have to say this wicket was exceptionally dusty given how early it is in the season. There was actually less grass on the pitch than hair on the skipper&rsquo;s head, if you can imagine such a sight.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Anyway, the hairless wonder contrived to lose the toss and the All Stars (with only nine men) commenced their heroic attempt to live up to their name by batting first. Early runs were hard to come by, even though the ball appeared to change colour after a handful of deliveries. Buffalo Bilal was bowling from my end and the evil-looking Victor (KP) from the other. Both were bowling a decent line and length and the Bison was unlucky not to take a sharp caught and bowled.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The first breakthrough came via the Mediaeval Long Bowman. Your beloved Olly had been cunningly placed at a shortish fine leg and his colossal fingers were soon employed to scoop up a ball down to his left. It was a truly fine moment for your betrothed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The All-Stars number three then elected to retire for a bit, citing &lsquo;dehydration&rsquo; and the VCC &nbsp;&lsquo;dangerman&rsquo; Alan White was brought on for a couple of overs. I can tell you that my contemporaries at the other end have just confessed to me that they never once felt in danger of being knocked over by the old Portsmouthian&rsquo;s off-spin. I, however, feared for my safety with the introduction of Village debutant David &lsquo;Gowery&rsquo; Lowrie. Sure enough, I was soon uprooted by a penetrative ball from the new boy, this following a sharp catch taken by somebody in a fielding position that I can&rsquo;t quite recall. (I am not assisted by the scorecard in this regard)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Then in a pivotal moment of the game, the French lad Jean-Luc Erotique was introduced for one of the most menacing spells of ultra-slow bowling ever witnessed in North London. The Gallic marvel straddled the drinks break with a breathtaking series of five extraordinary overs which had fielders running, batsmen heaving and umpires stretching their arms in all directions. Extras were inevitably conceded but by the end of his spell (3-23) Lucarotti had ripped through the heart of the middle order, including the vital wicket of Hempton, who departed caught at mid-off by KP. And all of this in spite of an earlier shelling of a regulation chance by Bomb.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Questions were being asked at this point as to whether the All-Stars would make it past the century mark. Discharge made a welcome return to the Village attack following a dubious hand injury. The Caddick-alike rolled back the years and soon claimed the wicket of Duncan with another catch being taken that I can&rsquo;t quite remember. Another debutant, Jez &lsquo;Sir Francis&rsquo; Drake had been steaming in from the other end and having cabbaged his hand attempting one catch off his own bowling he soon took another. This left Marcus Aurelius and new boy Sabi to mop up the tail with a wicket each and the All-Stars had managed to crawl to an almost defendable 128.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I should mention at this point that Ed Thomas had been playing for the Village today until moving into the shack at 2.55pm in order to watch the Toffeemen strut their stuff at Wembley in the FA Cup Final. I understand that over the course of the last 90 or so minutes the Rocket Man has formed a very strong friendship with a small boy equally entranced by the football. I do hope that this close relationship does not distract Mr Thomas when he comes out to bat.</div>

<div>Dear Sergio,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Much has happened since I last wrote. Some of it was interesting but sadly the majority was slightly less so. I can tell you that the Village easily chased down the 129 runs needed for victory.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The story began nicely as your dreamboat Olly strode forcefully to the crease and soon set about destroying the visitors&rsquo; bowling with some excellently timed shots. Sabi (who perhaps should be renamed Wabi-Sabi in light of the Japanese aesthetic centered on the acceptance of transience) departed swiftly, bowled for just the one run. This heralded the arrival of the Rocket Man, gritty determination personified, who was clearly attempting to salvage something from a day where his beloved Blues had been shot down by Chelski. Naturally, he was bowled first ball and I was uprooted once more.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In came Buffalo Bilal and it was clear that he had no intention of departing the crease without entering the hallowed double digit territory. This was achieved smartly. You&rsquo;ll be pleased to hear that the WLD and the Bison were rocking along nicely and hitting boundaries at will. The tale takes a sorry twist however as the Morgmeister was caught by the traitorous VCC skipper who was fielding at mid-off.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Three down and Village teams of the past might well have folded. Not a chance when a team has a being as composed and beautiful as Marcus Littlejohns batting at five. He may love fielding and he may like keeping wicket but he absolutely adores batting and this has been evident this season in compiling his average of 187. Once the True Emperor was stationed at the crease, the All-Stars knew that the game was up, knowing as they did that Marrow will never play an aerial shot. The Buffalo departed, bowled, having hit an excellent 34, which meant that Alan John White would have the opportunity of steering the Village to victory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Bomb, with his only attacking shot of an innings that hit a new low in terms of tedium (9* off about 700 deliveries), hit a boundary to ease the Village to 130 and seal the match. Sergio, at this point you may feel that this uncharacteristic example of risk-taking was worthy of some applause. It wasn&rsquo;t. The run-scoring shot was only played after Mr White had learnt Marrow was 3 runs shy of a deserved half-century.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>Dear Sergio,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I&rsquo;m very frightened indeed. Given my position, I can&rsquo;t see anything but I have been hearing some very curious sounds in the past couple of hours. I just hope that they aren&rsquo;t hurting each other.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I&rsquo;m going to put it all to one side in order to give you my nominations for awards from today&rsquo;s match. Man of the Match has to go to the Buffalo for an excellent all-round performance with bat and ball, with honourable mentions to Marrow and the Marathon Man. The mantle of Village Idiot narrowly escapes Alan White for his drop and ruining of Marrow&rsquo;s glory, to rest at the feet of Ed Thomas in celebration of his truly awful sporting day which encompassed his team losing in the cup final, missing tea and being out for a golden duck.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>See you soon I hope</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
