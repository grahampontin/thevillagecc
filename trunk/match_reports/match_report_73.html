<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="">Cricket is a cruel mistress: one minute she&rsquo;s cooing in your ear, the next she&rsquo;s savagely kneeing you square in the nuts. On Saturday, against London Fields, The Village CC experienced both sides of this fickle personality. For the first hour or more of the game, cricket was blowing us kisses and sending us flirty text messages. By the time stumps were drawn shortly before 7pm, she had pointed and laughed at our inadequacies before sleeping with our best friend and posting the video on YouTube.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="">Having lost the toss, stand-in captain Alan White took two wickets in his opening spell to leave Fields struggling at 16-2 in the ninth over. The second wicket, in particular, was a beauty, an away-swinger finding the edge of Teasdale&rsquo;s blade before being scooped up brilliantly at slip by a diving Andy Richardson. At the other end, Dave Ireland bowled superbly for no reward, his six overs going for just 13 runs. By the time drinks were taken in the 16<sup>th</sup> over, Fields had just 50 on the board, and captain Jason Lord was struggling with a back injury.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="">Any hope The Village may have had of keeping their opponents to a respectable score soon began to evaporate, however. Lord bravely battled to 23 before hitting Chris Pitcher&rsquo;s delivery to an alert Ireland while, at the other end, opener Robin Friend had put his earlier scratchiness behind him and was beginning to find his feet. He would go on to make an unbeaten 116, an innings that combined watchful defence with severe punishment of anything loose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="">Friend was ably supported by Alec, who hit a snigger-inducing 69 before being well caught on the long-on boundary by Matt Riches, one of two victims for The Example, Eklavya Gupte. The Village&rsquo;s bowlers all performed manfully, with Craig Woodhouse finding some dangerous inswing and <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Richardson</st1:place></st1:city> unlucky to finish wicketless, but were unable to stem the flow of runs, as Fields added 170 for the 4<sup>th</sup> wicket at a rate of 10 an over. The Village at least managed to end on a high, with Chris Pitcher taking a fine catch off the final ball of the innings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="">Facing a daunting target of around 250, The Village aimed to learn from Fields&rsquo; example. Openers Ed Thomas and Andy Richardson were under orders to build a platform and charged with seeing out the first 5 overs. This they did, with few alarms, but off the final ball of the sixth over, Thomas committed cricketing suicide, setting off for a run that was never there. He was sent back by his partner but got there too late as the opposition, sharp in the field all afternoon, got their first wicket. Still, at 16 for 1 and with captain White on his way in, there were still causes for optimism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="">These soon evaporated, though, as The Village slumped to 28 for 7 in just 42 balls. It&rsquo;s probably best not to dwell too much on the collapse (England&rsquo;s middle order take note: THIS is how you do it), but special mention must be given to Bomb, for running out Graham, and chatmaster John Lucarotti, for demolishing his own stumps with his backswing before hitting the ball straight to a fielder for an easy catch and an excellent double dismissal. Lucarotti was involved in more drama just a few minutes later when Bomb, returning to the sidelines having been bowled for 5, hit him a glancing blow with his purple helmet. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="">Some late-order resistance for Dave Ireland pushed The Village up towards 50, but they could not even make that. <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ireland</st1:place></st1:country-region>, with 14, top-scored for The Village and the 9 runs he put on with Woodhouse was, damningly, the side&rsquo;s second highest partnership of the innings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="">All in all, then, a chastening experience for The Village. However, some positives can be drawn from the game. The performance in the field was good, with energy levels maintained throughout the 36 overs and some stunning catches taken. The bowling of White and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ireland</st1:place></st1:country-region>, in particular, was excellent and would have been enough to rip through less experienced teams. The game was played in a good spirit, and everyone headed off to the pub to get righteously fucked on Czech beer. There was a fine Wagaho turn out and no crazies invaded the pitch. All in all, much better the spending your Saturday inside, dismally knocking one out while watching Shipwrecked: <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Battle</st1:place></st1:city> of the Islands. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="">Man of the Match: Some strong contenders, including: Chris Pitcher for a wicket, a fine catch and some solid chat; Andy, for a stunning take at slip, resilient bowling and a restrained innings at the head of the order; and Bomb, for leading the best pre-match huddle in Village history and taking two wickets. However, in the end there can only be one winner. Step forward David Ireland &ndash; always a threat throughout his 6 overs, sharp in the field and top-scorer with 14 runs. Good work, sir.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="">As for Village Idiot of the Week, I&rsquo;m going to give that to myself, for dropping a catch off Andy late in the innings and then running myself out to set the whole collapse in motion. What a twat. Bring on the next game, and a chance to make amends.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
