<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><strong style=""><o:p></o:p></strong></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">I awoke to a ringing sound somewhere deep inside my head. It was the Sunday of the Village&rsquo;s Wiltshire tour and I hadn&rsquo;t yet uncorked my breakfast. Closer inspection revealed that the ringing was not so much due to last night&rsquo;s libations at the <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bell</st1:place></st1:city> in Broughton Gifford, as due to a pulsating and vibrating telephone at my bedside. Working on the principle that we are given mobiles to conceal our whereabouts, I put the &rsquo;phone onto silent and my head beneath the pillow. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">Somewhat later I emerged and lent over the kettle in the hope that a super-strength coffee would pick me up. It didn&rsquo;t, but the dulcet tones of my old chum A E McC Richardson-Richardson finally dislodged the ringing. Now, McClarence, a portly fellow at the best of times, was wandering around the kitchen in a pants and football shirt. It looked as if he had been poured into his clothes and forgotten when to say &lsquo;when&rsquo;. &ldquo;Cricket?&rdquo; he asked me and &ldquo;crikey&rdquo; I thought, remembering that my old whites and new pants had gone west in the previous night&rsquo;s jollities. I was under-equipped for action. They were probably now lying somewhere betwixt and between Holt and Broughton Gifford in a crumpled pile next to my dignity which, I must admit, I&rsquo;d shelled at a similar time. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">Anyhow, the old cove <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Richardson</st1:place></st1:city> clarified his question, saying &ldquo;is today&rsquo;s match on? It rained again last night.&rdquo; Suddenly I put two and two together. Showing an ingenuity hitherto unknown since I got a double merit in CDT, I remembered the telephone call and checked on the answer phone. It was a certain Kevin Ferrari of Witham Friary Cricket Club explaining that they had a puffy pitch, and, unless we were wearing our sea legs, we&rsquo;d be confined to land training. Thank Christ, I thought. A few quick scratches of the brow later and hitched up a pretty good alternative. Milly &ldquo;Woodlouse&rdquo; Woodhouse suggested that the chaps all fancied a bit of sport, and, remembering innocent summers of my youth, a post-lunch rubber of rounders was arranged. Quickly decanting ourselves into KP&rsquo;s roadster, we tore off into the country.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">Having read some of the H.E. Bates novels and knowing his Do-si-do from his Gay Gordons, ex-Marathon Man John Lucarotti informed us on country etiquette. Apparently these country types are rather unused to the horseless carriage, he stated, suggesting that we waved and wailed at passers-by to heed our right of way. Though the locals of Holt and some of the smaller villages seemed willing to humour us by waving back, I got the impression that Pukalotti had not read his Bates too closely. Many pedestrians gave us the sort of look normally reserved for the sort of visitor who leaves his butter in the marmalade, and several no doubt made disparaging remarks about care in the community as our chariot roared past. By the time the wagon pulled up at our luncheon venue, the journey had seen more shouting and waving of hands than it takes to order dinner in foreign restaurant. I was quite relieved to be free from the screaming horde, who headed for restoratives with the sort of enthusiasm that Maverick Dave Ireland usually reserves discussing for Morrant Sports. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">Once we&rsquo;d left lunch and reached the rounders venue, we found ourselves not so much in the soup as up to our ankles in water, with the Witham Friary recreation ground being totally flood drenched. After a brief refuelling stop, which saw Woodlouse purchasing a veritable bath tub of take-out scrumpy in plastic bottles, we headed for higher ground and rounders at Chapmanslade. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">Now here, dear reader, I must intervene and relate a brief interlude from Lord Bomb of Bell End, who at this point provided light intermission and subtle teaching much as the fool does in Shakespeare. And, while you may no doubt ask &lsquo;who are you to comment on savant teachings and Willy Shakers?&rsquo; dear reader, I must remind you that I once won the Broughton Gifford and Holt Scout Troop prize for reciting patriotic verse in iambic pentameter, which coupled with my double merit in CDT, clearly marks me as leading authority. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">Bomb, using all of his media and journalistic experience, seemed to be proposing that the bods at television centre took dumbing down to a new level and allotted the entire natural history unit&rsquo;s output to a series entitled &ldquo;Nature versus The Bomb&rdquo;, which would feature unarmed combat between him and various representatives of the animal kingdom. Though I don&rsquo;t recall Bomb&rsquo;s days in the CCF myself, most of his stories from those times don&rsquo;t mention much by way of bravery or bison wrestling. Instead, they seem to recall cowardice, indolence and getting more stoned and drunk in the bushes than even a lower-order Further Friars batsman could manage. Nevertheless, undaunted, Al Bombese continued to expound on the damage he could do to a Blue Whale with a bombiknocker and how he could dispatch a fine stallion with a well-aimed head butt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">While The Bomb detailed the minutiae of poodle-stabbing to anyone who would listen, I found a game of rounders had kicked off around me. A rudimentary pitch had been erected from a collection of handbags and jackets, while a pile of cider flagons stood at second base. Two fairly arbitrary teams led by Potty and Woodlouse battle. My first ball was tossed lightly to Maverick Ireland who walloped it with aplomb. This was not the Emerald Isle&rsquo;s first first of the tour. The day before he&rsquo;d unadvisedly demanded three large Madeiras from the <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Bell</st1:place></st1:city> at Broughton Gifford. As the 6X-supping locals looked on in disbelief, the comely serving-wench replied &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t do cake&rdquo; to old Emerald, &ldquo;but I could make you a cheese roll,&rdquo; which suggests they regulars prefer <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">marsala</st1:city></st1:place>. But back to the rounders where after some big hitting and catching of sharp chances, Woodlouse&rsquo;s team notched up 2 &frac12; rounders in their innings.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">Next came our turn to bat, in an innings of some skill, which saw us stealing a few quick rounders and most of second base, we registered an impressive 8 rounders. This was mainly due to some sloppy fielding from my fellow bounder Bomb, who seemed to be busily engaged stamping on earth worms and giving threatening glances to passing invertebrates. While no one seemed to know any of the rules of rounders, it seemed that all and sundry were willing to suggest them based mainly on their knowledge of other games, and rounders quickly descended into a bastard hybrid of boules, baseball, lacrosse and shove ha&rsquo;penny. Nevertheless, a second innings followed with Team Woodlouse registering 7 &frac12; rounders to Team Potty&rsquo;s 2 &frac12; not out, with muggings biffing a whole rounder to prove there&rsquo;s more to a Page than just CDT and blank verse.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">The Villagers, some by now tired, others tired and emotional, climbed back into KP&rsquo;s hotrod. And, while Bomb made head-butting gestures at grazing dairy cows in adjacent paddocks, the tour dispersed, with some returning to London and others staying for further revelry in Holt.</font></p>
