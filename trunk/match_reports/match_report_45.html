<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">With the first two clashes of the season washed out, the game between London Fields and The Village at London Fields assumed even greater significance. Fields were undefeated in the league coming into the game and knew that, barring a series of unlikely upsets, a victory over The Village would secure them the NELCL title once again. The Village, for their part, had suffered a disappointing loss to <st1:place w:st="on">Island</st1:place> two weeks previously and were desperate to get their title chase back on track.<o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Village captain GC Pontin was able to field a strong side, with the only notable omissions being talismanic former leader AEMcC Richardson (in Sheffield with a mop and bucket) and Oliver JLloyd Morgans (who had decided to accept an offer of work rather than accepting the opportunity to flay the Fields bowling attack). The Fields team was made up of familiar faces, one of whom was even said to be eschewing the traditional pre-match pint in favour of a dip in the nearby lido.<o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Miraculously, given his travails earlier in the season, Pontin won the toss and elected to bowl, backing a strong bowling line-up to deliver. However, a key member of said bowling line-up, a Mr Dave Ireland, was nowhere to be found when the time came to take the field. Several phone calls later, a few salient points became clear: 1) DI had thrown a party on Friday night. 2) It had gone rather well. 3) He was hungover. 4) Or possibly still drunk.<o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">The self-proclaimed Maverick was not to arrive for over half an hour, by which time the LF openers had set about their task with gusto. An unusually wayward KP Bowman was given sharp treatment by Fields skipper Dave Hickey, while Bomb was unlucky at the other end, with a couple of edges failing to go to hand. The partnership was eventually broken thanks to a memorable piece of fielding by KP, who atoned for his early performance with the ball by running out Graham with a direct hit from the deep.<o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Village were confident of turning one wicket into two and new batsman Jason looked edgy early on, with Bomb maintaining a fine line. He began to settle, though, and would go on to make a steadfast 75, boosted by some lovely drives in front of the wicket. Hickey was the next wicket to fall, well caught behind by Ed Hayles off the bowling of the much-missed <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ireland</st1:place></st1:country-region> but, once again, The Village couldn&rsquo;t force their way though the opening and Jason and new partner Will were able to push on at a run rate of more than 7 an over.<o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Captain Pontin brought himself on and successfully slowed up the scoring rate with an accurate stream of floaters and shooters that occasionally had Will in all sorts of trouble. He survived, only to be finally cleaned up by a resurgent KP three runs shy of his 50. By this point, Fields were closing in on 250, finally making it thanks to some lusty blows from new batsman John. The LF innings had not been without incident, with a string of unsuccessful LBW shouts followed by a rulebook-testing run out appeal, but ultimately the score seemed a fair reflection of the way the 35 overs had gone.<o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">The Village, with a middle order packed with explosive stroke players, needed a solid opening partnership and Pontin sensibly left the first ball of the innings, watching as it passed well wide of off stump. He gave the same treatment to the next delivery, only to watch in horror as it turned like an off-break to crash into his off pole. Next in, Ed hit an early boundary to get some runs on the board, but the Village were already in trouble.<o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Circumspect as always, Bomb took on Fields other opening bowler, a fiery right armer. After bowling just 8 deliveries, a painful hamstring injury brought an unfortunately early end to what was shaping up to be a good contest and Fields were forced to continue with just 10 men.<o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Having played some uncharacteristically flamboyant strokes, Ed perished for 12, a slip catch giving John his second wicket. There then followed an England-style middle order collapse, as vice-captain Lucarotti ran himself out having looked in fine nick, A-Bomb holed out for 20 and KP and Will Hayles both fell cheaply. An early finish and a dismal defeat seemed a certainty. Just a shame no-one had told Ed Hayles. After an uncertain start, the &lsquo;keeper soon unleashed a range of cracking shots, including one straight six that went, to paraphrase Richie Benaud, &ldquo;straight into the confectionary stand and back out again.&rdquo; Ably supported by Page and DI, who added some lusty blows of his own on his way to 26, Hayles began to push the score along and The Village began to think the unthinkable.<o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Fields have admirable strength in depth, however (they used 9 bowlers in all) and were able to remove Maverick, finally exposing The Village&rsquo;s tail. With the run rate becoming insurmountable, Ed Hayles eventually fell for 92, a wonderful effort and one of the finest innings ever played by a Village batsman. Man-of-many-nicknames Craig Woodlouse survived the last few balls but, as the 35 overs came to an end, The Village had fallen short by over 60 runs.<o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Bloodied but unbowed, The Village headed off to the boozer to drown their sorrows. It had been a tough, uncompromising game and, while The Village had played very well in patches, they had ultimately failed to match Fields over the full day&rsquo;s play. Still, the way they fought on when all had seemed loss bodes well for the future. Maybe next year, the title will be theirs. <o:p></o:p></font></font></span></p>
