	<pre><font face="Arial Narrow"><b>London Fields 112-3 beat Village 111 by 8 wickets </b>
  
Take your bat and pads 
'Cos we're going to play London Fields 
But all our appeals 
Were nothing much to shout about 
A tale of hopeless endeavour</font></pre>
</div>
<div align="center">
	<pre><font face="Arial Narrow">Appealing is easy with eyes closed 
Misunderstanding all you see 
The Village needs to find someone 
to bowl them out 
and bring the team to Victory
</font></pre>

<div align="center">
	<pre><font face="Arial Narrow">We were ten wickets down 
'gainst the bowlers from the London Fields 
A batting ordeal: 
Top order barely hung about, 
The tail ain't scoring much ever. </font></pre>
</div>
<div align="center">
	<pre><font face="Arial Narrow">The Fields batsmen have hit a tree 
I mean our bowling's not that slow, 
That is you can't, you know, defend </font></pre>

<div align="center">
	<pre><font face="Arial Narrow">A small total. 
That is our bowling's not too bad. </font></pre>

<div align="center">
	<pre><font face="Arial Narrow">We were taken down 
'Cause their bowlers had plentiful yields 
But all our appeals
Were nothing much to shout about
Their weaselly umpire's clever.  </font></pre>

<div align="center">
	<pre><font face="Arial Narrow">Always hope someone scores fifty 
But you know for us it's just a dream 
I hope each match I'll score a ton. 
But it's all wrong. 
Never for Village CC. </font></pre>
</div>
<div align="center">
	<pre><font face="Arial Narrow">We took our bat and pads 
When went out to play London Fields 
A batting ordeal 
As no-one really hung about 
Our batsmen ain't scoring much ever,
Our bowler's beat last week's endeavour,   
A win will be sweeter than ever.</font></pre>
