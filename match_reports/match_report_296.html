<conditions><p><strong>Weather</strong>: &nbsp;Hot, sunny</p>
<p><strong>Track</strong>: Straw-like, variable bounce</p> </conditions><p>&nbsp;The Village got back to winning ways against stand-in opposition the Bengal Troopers after a closely fought battle on a tricky pitched resulted in a 27 run victory. It had been over a month since the Village&rsquo;s last win (against the Demijohns in Oxford) and two months since Captain Troja has himself got that winning feeling.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In keeping with his favoured approach, Troja won the toss and batted on a pitch which proceeded to jump, pea-roll and deviate extravagantly. After scrapping through a few tight early overs from the Troopers, TdM got one that rose slightly less than others and took the edge to be held smartly at slip for 13. Grey Ham Pontin soon followed with another catch behind the wicket, albeit this time via a skied pull shot.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Rebuilding was required and was set about by a watchful Cressey and a more-expansive Troja. The introduction of spinners saw the momentum shift towards the Village however with Troja driving the off-spinner for 6 over extra cover and Cressey sweeping one of many googlies from Syed over the fence for 6 more. The partnership continued to grow with Troja passing 50 with the Village sitting on 125-2 off 26 and Cressey joining the 50-club for the season soon after via an overthrow leaving the Village on 145-2 from 28. Cressey (56) soon departed however to an inside edge on to the stumps to end a 100+ partnership which saw 4 balls permanently lost to the hedges of Parliament Hill. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Aggressive support from Pitcher, Bn, Abrar and Bossy pushed the score along further, but the star of the show remained Troja who dominated the scoring for the last 10 overs to finish on exactly 100*. On a pitch that moved around as much as it did early on and faced with a consistent bowling attack, this was an exceptional effort and&nbsp; especially so in a match where only 2 other batsmen (Frank aside) passed 30. The Village finished on 215-6 from the allotted 40 and Troja enjoyed a celebratory slice of melon.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Troopers&rsquo; innings got under way with Bosshardt in particular challenging the opening batsmen with testing lines and lengths and testing Keeper Pontin with multiple gazzunders which either slammed into his pads or the boundary rope. Bossy was rewarded with 2 wickets at the top of the order to put the Village in early control. In keeping with the order of the day, the 3<sup>rd</sup> wicket stand began to bring the Troopers back into the game with Rubel and Marub dispatching the ball to the fence regularly and with great force. It took the introduction of Our Lord and Saviour Eddy Francis to break this dangerous combination courtesy of a well flighted delivery which Rubel skied to give Pontin a revenge keepers catch.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Comedy moment of the day went to Eddy and Pitcher who combined to run out number 5 Mahabub, who failed to ground his bat. The more interesting slice of action from this dismissal however came when Pitcher threw the ball to the bowlers&rsquo; end in a direct line which (for a split second) contained Troja&rsquo;s head. The captain squealed, emptied his bowels, fell flat on the floor but ultimately got out of the way to ensure the run out was completed.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">An exceptionally tight spell of bowling from Ben Hampton (2-15 off 8) put the game almost beyond reach of the Trooper&rsquo;s batsmen, but a steady flow of byes (40 in total #notgrahamsfault) kept the game alive until EK took a sharp return catch to dismiss Rajib and Bossy returned to finish off the job leaving him with 3-12 off 7.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Special mention to Cesca who had prepared water for the drained Villagers as we came off the pitch and Bosh for turning up and offering inspirational advice and excellent video analysis of Troja's ton.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">All in all, a good day out in the hot sun against good opponents followed by a decent Sunday evening session in the Vine.<o:p></o:p></p>
