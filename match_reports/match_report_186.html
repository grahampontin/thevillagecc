<conditions><p>Hungover.</p> </conditions><p>After a series of timing and lunch venue mix-ups, day two of the Wiltshire tour saw Village descend on Rhode CC&rsquo;s ground an hour early and with no clue about the light rating of the oppo.</p>
<p>The Kiwis kicked the rugby ball around (or threw it in disabled Bun&rsquo;s case) and excitedly chatted about New Zealand&rsquo;s World Cup campaign. A suggestion that they will most likely crash out with a heartbreaking loss in the semis to the eventual runners-up was met with muttered prayers about Dave Dobbyn and Alex Wyllie.</p>
<p>Village took the field in the unusual proposition of bowling first on a smallish ground and fairly low and slow pitch. Childhood memories of backyard cricket came flooding back for some Villagers due to the six and out rule being in place straight down the ground at one end.</p>
<p>Morgans was delighted by the new rule and insisted that it be included in all future VCC matches.</p>
<p>Bun wasn&rsquo;t perturbed by the rule. &ldquo;You think a guy in a $6300 suit isn&rsquo;t going to try to hit a six anyway - COME ON!&rdquo; he shouted while lying on his back on a bench near a tractor path.</p>
<p>So to the game. Frankenstein&rsquo;s monster #Boa2012 and #KP2009 ripped through the top order, the latter castling a quality bat with a cracking off cutter that left him still puzzled when he came out to umpire ten overs later.</p>
<p>In a smart bowling move, Craig David brought on C-Pitch to take advantage of the slow wicket, and he responded with two quick wickets.</p>
<p>With Rhode five down for not many, it was time for a classic Village mental breakdown as batsmen six and seven took to the Louse and Jesus to put on around 100 before Becker broke through.</p>
<p>RS and N*Sync&rsquo;s manager bowled tightly to pick up three of the lower order cheaply, with Roade posting 160 off 35 overs &ndash; arguably par for the pitch but slightly disappointing for VCC given our flying start.</p>
<p>A top-notch BBQ lunch was served without a Sainsbury's Basics sandwich in sight.</p>
<p>The par score suddenly went up as Roade&rsquo;s opening bowling attack proved itself to be one of the best VCC has faced all season, with a left armer sending them down at pace and a right armer moving it all over the shop.</p>
<p>Village got off to a bad start when AAP suffered arguably the cruellest fate by being run out for a diamond duck. VCC&rsquo;s new bowling allrounder RS and the public transport lady pest Morgans rose to the challenge and put on a solid 50ish partnership before the Welshman was triggered by The Saviour.</p>
<p>The Great Village Collapse &trade; followed as surely as night follows day.</p>
<p>Australia&rsquo;s Daniel Vettori unexpectedly got bowled by a yorker, bringing on a five-hour funk.</p>
<p>JT Hindle was triggered by Morgans and went home in disgust (eyes passim).</p>
<p>A wild-eyed EK chased a high and wide ball, giving point a simple catch.</p>
<p>Former skipper Bob Crow did his standard heave across the line and had middle stump bent back.</p>
<p>The collapse was halted by the Creator and the Created, who put on 60-odd against an attack that was getting slower by the over. Blessed occasionally with some luck, the duo slowly progressed towards the total, but began to struggle to get away the slower bowlers.</p>
<p>With four needed off the last over, Boa2012 clipped a one, bringing Becker on strike.</p>
<p>Gurrrrrrrr, whose stock ball (canny in retrospect) was a half tracker which ended up around ankle height to the batsman, subsequently bowled a couple of dot balls.</p>
<p>Hope was still high &ndash; four needed off three balls. #NO2AB urged Becker from the sidelines to &ldquo;send it home&rdquo; and say &ldquo;see ya later ball&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And so, after helping meticulously piece a broken innings back together, Becker proceeded to smash it to pieces in front of a visibly upset Village supporters group.</p>
<p>Trying to hit the third ball of the over towards a vacant cow corner, he was badly beaten by the downward trajectory and bowled by Grrrrrrrrr.</p>
<p>Louse took the field accompanied by a Red Arrows flyover and fireworks. Could Rhode smell what the Louse was cooking?</p>
<p>Yes, it turns out. The Evening Standard&rsquo;s finest danced up the pitch to negate the ankle ball and was promptly stumped.</p>
<p>One ball left, four to win. Could Eddy roll the stone away?</p>
<p>No, as it turns out. Jesus couldn&rsquo;t quite middle the ball and Village was stuck three runs short of the total.</p>
<p>Despite the disappointment, VCC was united in its declaration that Roade CC were a bunch of good blokes and we&rsquo;d love to play them again; they even brought along a keg of very nice ale from one of the players&rsquo; brewery.</p>
<p>A spot of bus karaoke led by C Woodhouse failed to rouse RS from his funk, with the latter only finding his joie de vivre after a skinful of scrumpy and tequila.</p>
