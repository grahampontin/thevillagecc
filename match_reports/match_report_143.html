<conditions><p>Sunny. Slow, flat pitch. Perfect conditions for a collapse.</p> </conditions><p><span style="line-height: 115%; color: black; font-size: 10pt">So to Croydon for our first proper red light game -&nbsp;the Old Whitgiftians, a team&nbsp;captained by Marrow&rsquo;s housemate, Swiss Nazi gold hoarder and all round great guy Schaddy. And a very strong team the Village had on paper, with no fewer than 9 batsmen who&rsquo;d all scored 50s at one time or another. The ground and pitch were excellent &ndash; we&rsquo;d been promoted to the Old Whits first team square, which was true if very slow. Opening insults/banter with&nbsp;the oppo captain&nbsp;done, and straight into the game &ndash; KP won the toss and had no hesitation in batting.</span></p>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="line-height: 115%; color: black; font-size: 10pt">I&rsquo;m not sure how long we want to dwell on this, because it was pretty much the worst I&rsquo;ve ever seen a decent Village side play. The short version is that everyone got a start and got out. Many of us played some of the worst shots we&rsquo;ll ever play. The majority of the wickets fell to Schad&rsquo;s secret weapon, a spinner who came in off two paces and buzzed down quick off breaks that for the most part didn&rsquo;t turn. If anything, it was the lack of time between balls that did for some of us, as facing him was an odd experience &ndash; due to his accuracy and speed of delivery it was somewhat like taking on a bowling machine. But that&rsquo;s a poor excuse for such an abject performance. </span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="line-height: 115%; color: black; font-size: 10pt">For what it&rsquo;s worth, it went like this: Tarka played nicely then skied the aforementioned spinner, Plimms was trapped by an inswinger from the opening bowler&nbsp;(more on this in the next report), Morgs went for a wild drive over the ball against the same spinner, Marrow hit a couple of great shots then played a loose defensive stroke and saw it slip between bat and pad off the same bowler, I then tried to whack him over midwicket and missed, Naz ran himself out for no reason at all, Bilal played a wristy flick that looked very pretty and would have been even better if it hadn&rsquo;t looped straight to a man short on the leg side, Ek actually got a good ball that left him and beat his outside edge to bowl him, and finally KP and Martin both played very well, putting on 30 odd to show the entire top order that batting really wasn&rsquo;t all *that* hard before both were cleaned up attempting leg side heaves.</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="line-height: 115%; color: black; font-size: 10pt">Why did it go so wrong? I&rsquo;ve given it some thought, and honestly can&rsquo;t say for sure. As I&rsquo;ve said, the spinner&rsquo;s 4 wickets were deserved in terms of his accuracy (going at 2 runs an over will tend to induce farking silly shots), but he wasn&rsquo;t that good and all it would have taken was a little bit of patience from someone &ndash; there were runs out there. Certainly the rate&nbsp;at which his&nbsp;deliveries came&nbsp;did for me and I guess others.&nbsp;We&rsquo;re probably quite unused to dealing with pressure - it&rsquo;s not often these days that our middle order come in without some runs on the board, and a lot of them aren&rsquo;t used to having to guts it out for 5 or 6 overs and play out maidens. Also, some of our batsmen perhaps had a hangover from earlier in the season when we played weaker sides and knew there were either bad balls or even bad bowlers coming along. This lot didn&rsquo;t have anyone terrifying, but perhaps more importantly they didn&rsquo;t have anyone bad either. Sadly some of the teams we&rsquo;re going to play in the second half of this season will have better attacks than this one and it&rsquo;s not enough to just wait for some pies. </span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="line-height: 115%; color: black; font-size: 10pt">Alternatively, we just had a bit of a mare. Answers on a postcard. Anyway, we bowled and fielded like clowns too so the batting wasn&rsquo;t lonely, but deep down that was probably because we knew we were about 100 short. I opened with KP and while he was pretty tight I got spanked all over the shop, including one pull for four by Schad which really made my day. To be fair I&rsquo;m barely even a bowler these days and when I&rsquo;m opening it&rsquo;s fair to say the VCC might be lacking a few bowlers: the writing was on the wall. Eklavya did his best and even managed to get the holder of the least-coveted Blue in the world out (Hockey goalkeeper FWIW), and I got one at the end so at least someone else had a rubbish time, but all in all we were happy to get off the field. The other opener played very well indeed for his 80 but had about four lives...as previously stated, we really didn&rsquo;t cover ourselves in glory in any department. We&rsquo;re going to have to think about our strategy a lot more &ndash; when we turned up to Pacific with a few plans, we implemented them and gave a decent team a drubbing.&nbsp;They've picked themselves up since and piled on the runs&nbsp;&ndash; that&rsquo;s what we need to do.</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="line-height: 115%; color: black; font-size: 10pt">So anyway, apologies to the Old Whits for not giving them much of a game, and I hope they invite us back. Congrats too on how they played, barely putting a foot wrong and though it pains me to say it Schad captained well with some excellent field placings. He also played well in the touch rugby afterwards, which I discovered is a tough game to play after four pints of ale, and nearly vomited on Marrow&rsquo;s bouffant.</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="line-height: 115%; color: black; font-size: 10pt">Man of the Match: I guess Eklavya for being a bit less culpable than others in his dismissal and bowling well. KP could have it for his innings but then watching him and knowing how we&rsquo;d let him down was so depressing I don&rsquo;t think he can. Also whoever made the tea, it was good.</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="line-height: 115%; color: black; font-size: 10pt">Village Idiot: All XI who showed up. Yep, to a man. We were terrible.</span></div>
