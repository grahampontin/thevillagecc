<conditions><p>Hot and sticky. No sun bathers though.</p> </conditions><p>Despite aggressive recruiting from the St Anne's match Captain Bowman, VCC put out a decent 11 to take on old friends St Anne's All Stars. Village star, and part time 12th Man Impersonator, B Hampton decided to play for the other team, a decision derided by many a Villager as 'not totally unexpected'.</p>
<p>KP won the toss and elected to have a run around the paddock. Following some strong Boa chat during the week, Boa was promoted to the openning position along with Odlum. Boa was looking good and looked set to feast on some All-Star pies, but much to his frustration he was caught out taking a slash outside off stump. Odlum followed shortly after, having his stumps dismantled by Gren Thompson.</p>
<p>A Bomb batted at 3 and immediately looked in form, with text book defense to the odd straight delivery, while anything loose was despatched to the boundary. Bomb and EK looked to be cruising when Captain Bowman changed the course of the game, having EK out caught and Dev LBW without troubling the scorers. And in quick succession Bomb threw his wicket away one shot away from compulsory retirement at 50.</p>
<p>That brought D Ireland to the wicket to join Harty and All Stars responded with a double bowling change, pace twins Hampton and Langridge.  Langridge worked away at a length frustrating Harty into a false stroke, and later took out the middle stump of prize wicket Troja. Meanwhile Hampton continued his domination of D Ireland, sending him home with just 1 to his name. Hampton also removed Naz in a dismissal your correspondent cannot recall. Shortly after Village were all out for 123, with debutant C Burke stranded not out 1. Langridge finishing with career best figures of 3 wickets for 5 runs off 5 overs.</p>
<p>123 certainly looked a sub-par score, a point underlined as one S MacDonald plundered the Village bowling to all parts of Tooting Bec Common. Fortunately wickets fell regularly at the other end, with Naz and DI snaring 3 a piece, including the key wicket of Bowman in a dubious LBW decision. To Bowman's credit he walked off in good spirits - a display fitting of the good friendly nature in which the game was palyed.</p>
<p>Yet with MacDonald still at the crease an All-Star's win was still the favoured result, and it took the spin of Troja to finally remove Sam for a very well made 35. After Sam's departure debutant Burke took the ball and promptly cleaned up the tail order, taking 2 for 2 off his solitary over. So All-Stars fell 39 runs short. It was a fun game, enjoyed by all.</p>
<p>Man of the Match: Bomb, 47 runs and some solid chat</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Owing to the early finish we did have a 10 over beer match, Langridge made 25 retired for All-Stars and Burke 28 retired for Village. Hampton smashed Harty for a massive straight six. Village chased down the total with a ball to spare.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
