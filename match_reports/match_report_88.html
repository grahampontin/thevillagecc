To Hampstead Heath Extension, then, for our 2020 game against new fixture additions The John Minshull XI. And immediately, a problem. Stand in Captain AB received a call from our D of C upon his arrival. He had not, it transpired, brought stumps along. Apparently we 'never' bring stumps to midweek games. No, me neither. A hasty call to the JMS XI Captain revealed that they too, were stumpless. They began to search the shops of Golders Green for said apparatus, but apart from a three-pronged&nbsp; set of Hannukah candles, it appeared there was nothing to fit the bill.<br />
<br />
Like Kevin Pietersen in an ODI, we improvised, chinas. Two pairs of pads were hastily strapped together. We &quot;won&quot; the toss (JMS Captain: &quot;We're rubbish.&quot; AB: &quot;So are we.&quot; JMS Captain: &quot;We're more rubbish.&quot; AB: &quot;Are you sure about that?&quot; JMS Captain: &quot;Yes, you bat.&quot;) and elected to bat.<br />
<br />
Openers Pontin and Richardson began solidly, for all of two overs, before G-Funk lost his middle pad to a big inswinger. It was the JMS XI's first game, and he had the honour of being their first scalp. The joy was unbridled, their keeper charging up to the prostate pad and booting it high in the air in celebration. Out strode Goweresque number 3, PARP! who despite a puffy back had deemed himself fit to play. He and Richardson piled on the runs, thumping boundaries left right and centre <strike>and scampering quick singles.</strike> A splendid knock of 20 or something from PARP! - his best knock for the VCC so far - was terminated after a wholly unexpected run out, and Andy soon retired at 25.<br />
<br />
This brought to the wicket frighteningly beautiful middle order Harrovian Marrow, a man whose aggressive, dashing style of batting (and years of experience cabbaging rubbish bowling around for the Oriel 2nd XI) made him the perfect man for the job. Sure enough, he was bowled for 0, perhaps a result of the JMS XI's constant exhortations to hit it at the totty on the fine leg boundary. As a side note, we should note that their chat throughout the game was absolutely exemplary. Pointless clapping, cheering, even, on several occasions dancing - were all in abundance. Perhaps one reason for their strength is that, as made clear on email, their structure is not one of Captain, Vice, Players. It is in fact Captain, and then 10 Vices. Each man must take individual responsiblilty for his chat, and the results were extremely strong.<br />
<br />
Next in, work colleague of Graham Pontin, Dominic Sayers, who had been hastily and apologetically promoted up the order from number 10 after he'd revealed to AB that he was not, as reported, a bowler -but a batsman. And a damn fine one he was too, thumping sixes and fours with nary a concern, until an attack of cramp impeded him a little. For reasons best known to himself, AB felt that he'd be the best to take on running duties, and Dominic and sometime VCC opponent Allan Williamson continued to add lots of runs, probably about 40 but certainly at least 20 less than they would have if someone else had been running. We finished on 130 odd off 17 overs.<br />
<br />
Now would perhaps be a good time to point out that we didn't have a scorebook. No one on the oppo knew how to score, so we had to make do with a running tally of runs scored as that was all anyone could cope with. This lack of stats was good news for some people (Graham and Marrow), and bad news for others (MK Don, who bowled superbly to take 4 wickets). Little need be said about the JMS XIs response - we started with Allan Williamson but they found him a bit fast, and by the end even Ed Thomas got a much anticipated bowl. Most of us bowled well apart from the ones who didn't, and despite a decent start, they didn't get too close to the total, finishing about 20 short. <br />
<br />
To the pub for beers and sage advice from the older cricketing hands to these young upstarts. Among the advice: don't join a league. Do join a league. Recruit Australians where possible. And never leave home without stumps.<br />
