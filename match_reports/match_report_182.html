<conditions><p>Sunny. Like Liston.</p> </conditions><p>By Raymond Chandler</p>
<p>It was brighter than a Yale freshman. The pitch was flatter than a maple syrup pancake. But we were 28-6. Hampton had just gone in honourable fashion, attempting to send the ball HOME, and perennial batting underachiever Lyneham was walking out to join a stranded AB.</p>
<p>These guys were good. They played cricket like it was judgement day, and only those with a five-for were getting past St Peter. Page had been first to go, the graptolitholgist nicking off to slip from one that just left him. Ek gave them an action replay. Morgans went to a yorker. Ahmed gave them an action replay.</p>
<p>We were in the last chance saloon, and the barman had just called time. We didn't even have the number for a cab home.</p>
<p>But one guy wasn't having it. Where others floundered, he was&nbsp;firmer than a dietrician's stool. Alan White. AB. The greatest English batsman the Village has ever seen. Lyneham stuck with him. The Village fought harder than an alleycat with scabies. Agricola gave it everything - pace, swing, seam, spin. Maum stood out. Quick, aggressive, and tighter than a 57th St pawnbroker. Lyneham went to a run out. #Boa2012 and Louse chipped in. Bomb played a few shots as the innings came to a close. Somehow, 139&nbsp;was the&nbsp;final score.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enough?&nbsp;The Village were on 16, and the dealer was showing a face card.</p>
<p>There were no demons in the wicket, but the ball was harder to time than a Higgs-Boson particle. Boa bowled stump to stump. So did Lyneham: no one saw that coming, and he got the first one - his first bad ball hit to gully, where Morgans gobbled it up like a fat dame at a carvery. Then a few overs later he was at it again, this time off Boa. Hampton steamed in first change. The batsmen nudged and nurdled their way towards the total. Louse kept it tight. Suddenly, a pair of breakthroughs: Hampton seamed one through the gate, then extracted a leading edge from the number five, who'd taken guard half way down the track. As a statement of intent, he couldn't have made it clearer if he'd sent it by telegram. Ahmed&nbsp;waited, and then came up to the stumps.&nbsp;Back in his box, with a guard now scratched out on a good length.</p>
<p>This wasn't a game that was going to be won with a few big hits. Louse kept it tight, and finally broke through when&nbsp;the number three, who'd looked very solid,&nbsp;went for the big hit over midwicket. Now it really was 5050. Enter AB.</p>
<p>Some people thought he was past it. He's lost pace, they said. Doesn't swing it like he used to, they said.</p>
<p>They were wrong.</p>
<p>Five stunning overs, 3-7. First, a devious short pitched ball which bowled the batsman round the legs. Then a cunning full toss, hit straight to the Louse at mid off. Then a delicious delivery down the leg side which brushed the glove. Crafty stuff.</p>
<p>With that, the game was all but up. Agricola had found themselves cast in the role of hare, and they were up against one extremely pumped tortoise. Louse and Boa closed things out. We stepped into the night, for a bourbon, a gimlet&nbsp;and 40 Lucky Strike each.</p>
<p>Thanks to the opposition for stepping in at the last minute and for giving us a great game.</p>
