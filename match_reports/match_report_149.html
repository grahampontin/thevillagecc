<conditions><p>Hot and humid.</p> </conditions><p><span style="font-size: 10pt">Were you to bother to read the appallingly spelt Salix CC match report for this game, something I would advise against, you would hear about an excellent, match winning,&nbsp; innings from Salix debutant Khusla Ghuwalewala.&nbsp; This did indeed occur, however there was far, far, more to the game that this excellent individual performance.</span></p>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt">This was a game which turned not on any one batting or bowling performance, but several incidents in the field.</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Salix are a good bowling side: while not threatening, their six man bowling attack bowled few bad balls forcing VCC batsmen to improvise and take risks in order to hit boundaries.&nbsp; They are also a good fielding unit, with several quick close fielders who have yet to discover the delights of the &ldquo;long lunch&rdquo;.</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt">After the early dismissal of star bat Harty, James Hindle and Olly Morgans put together a steady partnership of 54 before the former was dismissed in a tight run out call.&nbsp; Disappointingly, Morgans followed two or three overs later, also run out. This was frustrating, as both players were well set and might have taken VCC to a winning score of 180 to 200 had they stayed together.&nbsp; We struggled in middle of the innings, Marcus Littlejohns understandably out of sorts after suffering a burglary the day before.&nbsp; After a rare failure from the Wood Elf, Skipper Bowman came in at 6 and batted excellently, driving the ball sweetly through cover and regularly hoisting the Salix spinners over midwicket.&nbsp; </span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Bowman hit 31, and was well supported by Bomb who pulled out a delightful little sweep shot late in the innings.&nbsp; He ensured we managed a competitive 164 from 35 overs.</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt">With the exception of the excellent Khusla Ghuwalewala, and a gutsy 31 from skipper Stuart Lumsden, Salix batted poorly.&nbsp; Their batsmen persisted in playing arial drives over mid on and mid off, despite the slow, uneven bounce which made this something of a gamble.&nbsp; In total they gave us something like 10 catches,&nbsp; which &ndash; had we taken &ndash; would have ensured we bowled Salix out for c. 100. Alas, we had another awful catching day and put <u>six</u> down.&nbsp; </span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt">One fielder who did not have an awful day in the field was Dr AA Page, who caught an absolute blinder jumping high at 1<sup>st</sup> slip.&nbsp; EK, Morgans and Hindle (the other close fielders) were astonished and there was a moments shocked silence before we all congratulated him on an effort Paul Collingwood would have been proud of.</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt">No side which drops so many catches can hope to win, and Village did not, despite and aggressive bowling spell towards the end of the innings from Aussie Harty: Steve grabbed two wickets in two balls, and might have had a hattrick had the Salix umpire not turned down a good LBW shout.&nbsp; Lazarus was not to walk again on this occasion however, and the Salix tail managed to score the 10 runs required at that stage to win by 3 wickets. </span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt">During the game there was also an extremely curious &ldquo;not out&rdquo; shout from the Salix square leg umpire, who suggested a ball Ghuwalewala had driven into the safe hands of Olly Morgans at gully early in his innings had somehow been a bump ball.&nbsp; It had not.&nbsp; Games turn on such moments occasionally, and Village bore their disappointment well.</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Player of the day: Alex Page, fielding superstar.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 10pt">Village idiot: </span><span style="font-size: 10pt">Salix persist in walking off the field en masse during drinks breaks in order to take drinks in the pavilion.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a truly bizarre spectacle, which makes one wonder if they suffer from mass fecal incontinence.&nbsp; I cannot therefore, reasonably, give the Village idiot award to anyone other than the Salix team.</span></div>
