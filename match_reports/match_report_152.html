<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font size="2">Things were going well for the Village being about 4/150, when Steve Loonstra was brought into the attack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His medium pacers were hitting the deck hard and we struggled to keep him out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He had Ali caught behind for 56, Naz bowled for 8, Abrahams caught in the gully for 1, and Pratik bowled for a duck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Matt Boa was out caught for 4, and meanwhile The Example was holding up the other end and was doing his best to get us to the 200 mark.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>EK took a single to bring up to 200 off the 4<sup>th</sup> ball of a Loonstra over, and Loonstra cleaned up C-Pitch to end the innings on 200 even. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Loonstra, finishing with 5/25 off 8 overs. </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font size="2">The opposition openned with Loonstra and he batted really well, while wickets fell regularly at the other end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>KP stuck first with a plumb LBW shout, and Pratik bowled well to pick up two further wickets after a 50 run partnership.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>C-Pitch then chimed in with a wicket, and the Sultans appeared to be struggling at 4/100.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However Loonstra was starting to increase his scoring rate and the total quickly got to 4/130, at which point KP threw the ball to Harty and said something to the effect &ldquo;you got us into this mess, now show us your <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Latest Trick</i> and get us out of it&rdquo;**.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Harty picked up 2 quick wickets, but not the key wicket.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So KP pushed the field back to give Loonstra the single and focus the attack at the other end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The strategy worked like a charm, with Pratik, Boa, EK all taking wickets, and the Sultans being 9 down with about 30 runs to get.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font size="2"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Local Hero</i> Loonstra at this point farmed the strike and worked off the runs, bringing up his hundred with a six!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Two overs later the match had come <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Down to the (Water)Line</i>, with the Sultans needing 7 runs to win with Loonstra on strike and 2 balls left in the over.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Next ball cut shot for 4.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So 3 runs required, one ball left in the over, Loonstra goes for a big cut shot from a lifting ball, thick edge, straight to fly slip, and a tough chance put down by Ali and the ball goes for 4.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Game over, Loonstra 113 not out, and victory to the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Sultans of Swing</i>.</font></p>
