The first game of the season is all about easing your way back in, blowing away the cobwebs and gaining some cheap runs and wickets. The Ironsides were only too happy to oblige.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">With a lineup containing seasoned campaigners and some relatively new faces, the Village won the toss and batted on a pitch that was April-green but fine. Harty and de Mellow opened up and got off to a brisk start against bowling that, while alright, was giving one or two boundary balls an over. After seeing off the openers, de Mellow decided to have a drive at the spinner and was caught behind for 38 (although &nbsp; after a bit of juggling between keeper and slip. SB Tang, in at three, didn't last much longer after being stumped for one. Morgans was in and out in even quicker time, LBW for 0, so in came Hampton, who had quit his job in the off-season to focus full-time on the Village. This life decision paid dividends as he and Harty (obviously while all this was going on, Harty was just smacking it around and being dropped by hapless fielders) built up a big partnership. Hampton was run out in unmemorable&nbsp;fashion &ndash; your correspondent was scoring at the time and even he can't remember it &ndash; and Woodhouse was out LBW for one. Troja had time to smack a boundary, and Harty had the timing to deliberately hit it in the air to the same fielder in consecutive balls with the knowledge that it was a dead-cert drop. He finished on 143* and the Village on 248-5.&nbsp;</div>

<div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">With Boa on the sidelines, the bowlers were raring to steal a march on the wickets table. Newly betrothed KP opened up with the very much unbetrothed Tommo. Ironsides didn't put up much opposition, with KP and Nick picking up a brace each after some decent Village catching. With one Ironside opener sticking around to build a score, the Village skipper brought himself on and produced some rippers to run through the remaining batsmen. Four were clean bowled, with the remaining scalp coming from some smart work from keeper Morgans (Oli also conceded no byes to go with his no runs. Well done Oli). It was good to see a bit of flight and drift in seamers conditions.&nbsp;</div>

<div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">With one man retired hurt, that was the end for the Ironsides, who finished on 75. The Villagers were able to fashion a beer jug out of an oversized kettle, before retiring to a pub near the station, seemingly with everyone else in Earlsfield. While there, a few Villagers learned the danger of questioning the abilities of a left-handed Australian batsman, born in Macksville NSW in November 1988, within earshot of a certain Villager...</div>
