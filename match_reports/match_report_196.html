<conditions><p>Blustery, rain showers, occasionally warm. Farmers market going on in the backround.</p> </conditions><p>It has been noted in certain correspondence that this author has muted the idea of some sort of Australasian quota system for the Village, reminiscent of the one the Coalition has put in place for immigrants. <br />
<br />
Sunday demonstrated why the Village must adopt this system. We need to protect our sports team and our work places from such unacceptable displays of competency! How else will us native Brits succeed?<br />
<br />
Its mid afternoon. As those on the boundary brave the cold wind and rain showers, Harty shifts his weight to the off side, effortlessly flicking another 6 over square leg. The next over Troja punches a glorious flat 6 over Long Off, from what Pitcher (a solid Brit) called a good ball. Unlike many of our new players, the ball had been forcefully sent home. The two run accumulators put on over 170 with both eventually retiring having demolished the opposition. Troja retained a modicum of honour by allowing some Brits a bat when in the 70s, Harty ensuring yet another ton against the Strollers before he too retired.

The game kicked off in the same vein. Morgs struggling to 13 before falling victim to a fine catch, being outplayed by KP at the other end who races to 30 before getting an inside edge off some tight bowling. Then came MMJL (Brit) who came and went in a flash after an uncharacteristic cross batted heave, before Harty and Troja did their best to resemble Australia of an early 90s vintage squashing the opposition in their wake. It's fair to say the Strollers' efforts were more enthusiastic than those of messrs Tufnell, Cork et al, but they were hampered by freezing weather and an astro pitch. The Village posted a barely believable 280.<br />
<br />
Even when getting injured the Antipodeans know how to do it. Graham Ponting is out before the match with an injury and has to be replaced. In contrast, Bun falls victim to a fractured knuckle joint in a pre game throw about. Following a 3 hour casualty wait and nothing but a splint and a bandage, he triumphantly returns.<br />
<br />
Following a fine tea once more the Strollers put up a spirited fight in their innings posting a respectable 220, in particular fine square cutting from Richardson and Fowler taking a liking to the (Brits) pies of Eddie and Bomb with a praise worthy 95 to his name . But to no avail, as our vitamin defficient hero returns from casualty mumbling about needing surgery to deliver a fine bowling display sending the off stump repeatedly cartwheeling and putting to the sword the Strollers' efforts. <br />
<br />
With further solid bowling from KP and Boa the Village has started to ressemble a Kiwi / Aussie double act. Bring back Stott, Sills and Rahilly I say! That was the real Albion Village spirit&hellip; The only notable exeption to colonial domination was with a fine catch at full speed by MMJL who used his trade marked crocodile catching technique to full afffect. With victory assured, the Village retired to a restuarant and in the spirit of showing these colonial upstarts how us Brits could produce fine food&hellip; we went for a curry. I'm off to join UKIP.</p>
