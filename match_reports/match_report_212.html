While Morgans continued to endear himself to the people of Corfu, the rest of the Village (apart from ill-Bomb) gathered themselves for the second match of the tour.&nbsp; The ground in Corfu Town presents a marvellously surreal setting for a game of cricket. Caf&eacute;s run the length of one square boundary, well within the hitting zone of our antipodeans. On the other side, the boundary does not finish at the edge of the grass but a good 15 yards further across a tarmac&rsquo;d public car park. Thankfully this had been emptied apart from one car which remained at deep midwicket/extra cover for the duration of the match. The wicket itself was covered with broken glass at the start of the day and the outfield may have featured a few presents from some stray dogs, but on the whole it was a fantastic setting and the lucky Villagers looked forward to a unique and memorable experience.</p>
<p>Spirros Morgans, the Village&rsquo;s foreign relations officer, had been appointed captain for the day and was immediately called upon to put his local expertise to test. Having prepared for a 50 over epic, the Village were slightly put out by the opposition&rsquo;s request for a Twenty20 biff. After much negotiation between Morgans (&ldquo;You ah playyeee 40 overs maybe please?&rdquo;), the President of the Corfu Cricket Association, Nicos (local tour manager / booker of tardy minibuses) and a local Umpire who was at great pains to point out that the fixture had disturbed his Sunday morning lie-in, a 30 over match was agreed upon.</p>
<p>The toss wasn&rsquo;t really a toss in that the opposition asked us what we&rsquo;d like to do. The Villagers decided to field first because it was going to be a bit hot later or something. It didn&rsquo;t take long to establish that Gymnastikos were not quite of the same standard as Saturday&rsquo;s opposition .as the openers struggled to get a bat on some fairly quick bowling from KP and Boa, who dismissed Boyrgidis and Koyrsaris. With a sub 50 total threatening to become a distinct possibility, Spirros made the wise decision to bring off the openers and turn to a few of the Village&rsquo;s slower bowlers.</p>
<p>It is a truly magnificent sight to watch John Lucarotti in full flow. These days &lsquo;mystery&rsquo; bowlers seem to pop up all over the place but the original is surely our very own Marathon Man. This writer maintains that there is nothing more befuddling for a batsman than trying to time a ball that&rsquo;s descending on a slow arc from around 25 feet. The aerial bombardment was soon rewarded and Lucarotti leapt down the pitch in Panesaresque delight as he picked up the wicket of Dimitris who lobbed up a simple catch to Littlejohns at point.</p>
<p>Troja caused most of the damage, recording an excellent four-fer, while some strong bowling from Gupte and Hampton, along with some not-so-strong bowling from Littlejohns and Morgans, allowed the Village to pick up the most of the remaining wickets while conceding enough runs to encourage Harty and others that they would have a reasonable total to chase. A determined rearguard action from Giannis and the Gymnastikos tail saw the home side reach a respectable total of 111.</p>
<p>The opening bowler for Gymnastikos was very good, bowling full and fast on the stumps and taking the early wicket of Hampton who was given LBW by Harty. Littlejohns then came in and scratched around for a bit before being bowled trying to cut a ball on centre stump. With Morgans getting out for his second duck of the tour and Troja being dropped at slip, the Village faced the amusing possibility of bumping up an opposition&rsquo;s total and then failing to come close to it. Fortunately Harty arrived at the crease with his A-Game and, together with Troja, took the game away from the opposition with some fine six hitting in to the nearby cafes. Both retired on 30 and it was left up to Bowman and Lucarotti to finish off the game with 15 overs to spare.</p>
<p>With the match finishing early, the Village decided to play a quick game of &lsquo;International&rsquo; vs &lsquo;Great Britain and India&rsquo; with the latter upsetting the odds and storming to a comfortable victory. This was followed by one of the tour&rsquo;s highlights when the Village were challenged to an 8 over game of tapeball cricket by a group of Afghan teenagers and young men. The Afghans were put in to bat and Corfu Town witnessed an absolute&nbsp; masterclass from a young man in a red T-shirt (&lsquo;Red Shirt&rsquo; as he shall forever be known). Red Shirt proceeded to tear apart the Village&rsquo;s finest bowlers with some ferocious boundary hitting and after 8 overs had put a mere 100 runs on the board. The Village made a valiant effort in reply but ultimately fell a long way short. Still, it was a lot of fun and great memories for all.</p>
<p>The rest of the evening was spent drinking, eating and showering before the group headed to the airport for their midnight flight back to Gatwick.</p>
