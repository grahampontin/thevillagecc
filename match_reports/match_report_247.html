<conditions><p>BAKING hot. Two paced pitch. </p> </conditions><p><i>Editor's note: the following marked homework was found at the ground  after the game. Having read about a similar initiative on the part of  the Australian test team, the VCC has been asking its players to submit  such assignments for several months. An upturn in our results suggests  Mickey Arthur may have been unfairly maligned.<br />
<br />
</i><b>Q1: With reference to recent history, describe how the  Village have played against London Fields in the past (5 marks).<br />
<br />
</b>A typical Fields/VCC game takes this format:<br />
<br />
1. VCC bat first.<br />
2. Comedy top order collapse. <br />
3. Lower order heroics.<br />
4. Mediocre total.<br />
5. Made to look even more mediocre once they knock it off in double-quick time.<br />
<br />
<i>5/5 Good<br />
<br />
</i><b>Q2: What mistake did Captain Gupte make at the outset of the game? (1 mark).<br />
<br />
</b>He failed to win the toss, meaning we were stuck in the field on a really hot day.<br />
<br />
<i>Correct. 1/1<br />
<br />
</i><b>Q3: Describe the first 20 overs of the London Fields innings (5 marks)<br />
</b>1. Bun and Boa both failed to grab a wicket, although lots of early drives on the two-paced pitch didn't go to hand.<br />
2. The 15 over chat vortex kicked in.<br />
3. Thommo picked up the first wicket thanks to a great catch low down at silly mid-on by captain Gupte<br />
4. Thommo immediately picked up the second wicket with an excellent late inswinger.<br />
5. We were on top.<br />
<br />
<i>3/5 lacks detail. The chat vortex actually  kicked in uncharacteristically early at 8 overs due to the heat.  However, the introduction of Thommo revitalised the Villagers' flagging banter , with mention made of various celebrity gingers and a certain  Villager's partner. Worth also noting the comedy field set due to AB's  &quot;insider knowledge&quot; of a certain batsman, only problem being that he  was thinking of a different batsman</i> <i>entirely, who wears a slightly similar hat.<br />
<br />
</i><b>Q4: Who else bowled well? (1 mark)<br />
<br />
</b>Chris Pitcher,  who tempted the well-set opener into a careless drive, well taken by  Morgs behind the sticks, and then temped the number five into a giant  moo across the line to bowl him. He was nagging and well suited to the  conditions.<br />
<br />
<i>Correct. 1/1<br />
<br />
</i><b>Q5: What happened next? (5 marks)<br />
<br />
</b>Fields'  No 4 Miller had been quietly ticking along while wickets had gone  at the other end. In the last 10 overs he went into overdrive<i>, </i>smashing  Ron Weasley for a couple of huge maximums. Clark, Turley and Fernbank  all chipped in to help him. Gupte bowled well and picked up the wicket  of Clark with probably his worst ball - a long hop that he missed -&nbsp; but  Troja and Francis were a bit below par and the fielding began to flag.  Even the normally solid Potty managed a comedy misfield through his  legs. Fields finished on 213, which was a decent score on that wicket, but  about 30 or 40 higher than they'd looked like getting at one stage. A  hot and exhausted Village staggered off the field of play.<br />
<br />
<i>3/5 Failure to mention Mr Pitcher's expensive drop when Clark had  just got to his 50. Should perhaps have mentioned that by this point  the chat vortex had become a chat black hole of unprecedented  proportions due to the heat. <br />
<br />
</i><b>Q6: Describe the VCC's batting plan<i> </i>in two points (2 marks)<br />
<br />
</b>1. Make sure the bowlers have to get you out at the start.<br />
2. Spank it around at the end.<br />
<br />
<i>2/2 good<br />
<br />
<b>Q7: </b></i><b>Describe how well the VCC's top order executed pt 1 of the plan (3 marks)<br />
<br />
</b>AB and Troja executed it very well - they made sure Fields' best  bowler Clark got them out, for 2 and 0 respectively, with AB looping up  a leading edge off one that stopped on him and Troj castled by a  nip-backer. Morgans failed to execute the plan by taking a suicidal single which  lead to a direct hit. De Mellow also failed by keeping  Clark/&quot;The Big Show&quot; out.<br />
<br />
<i>1/3 I think you've misunderstood the question.<br />
<br />
</i><b>Q8:  Was De Mellow's dismissal, caught behind trying to smash one two feet  down the leg side, the worst ball you've ever seen take a wicket in a  VCC game? Show your workings. (3 marks)<br />
<br />
</b>No. MMJL has bowled wicket-taking spells for the Village.<br />
<br />
<i>Correct.</i> 3/23 <em>(to be precise).</em><br />
<b><br />
Q9: Describe the &quot;boring&quot; middle overs (5 marks)<br />
<br />
</b>Potty  and Josh Homme began to rebuild, then expanded. Pontin, who had  previously been moaning about not playing &quot;man cricket&quot; at number 5,  cashed in on some loose offerings from the change bowlers. Highlights  included his trademark Sharapova forehand smash down the line, a top  edged leg glance for six over square leg, and lots of insufferable  shouty &quot;banter&quot;. Johnny Bairstow made life easy for the  scorers by making most of his runs on the other side of the wicket with a series of lofted cover drives interspersed with a few dicey  edges. VCC remained up with, but never ahead of, the run rate. Pontin  eventually went bowled for an excellent 76, his first significant score  against Fields since...possibly ever. <br />
<br />
<i>4/5 Good detail, important to note the entirety of this bit was  being livetweeted by #talktotroja to an increasingly captivated social  media audience.<br />
</i><br />
<b>Q10: Define &quot;man cricket&quot; (3 marks)</b><br />
<br />
1. Opening the batting (according to Potty).<br />
2. Sending Mr Pitcher in at 5/176 after 35 overs chasing 214.<br />
3. Watching Mr Pitcher, with four to win off the last over, pick up a relaxed single off the returning Clark <i>off his face</i>,  then cooly collecting the remaining three in overthrows as up to three  LFCC fielders closed in on the bowler's end to gather the return and all  failed to do so. Pick up your first win against said oppo since 2010  as a result.<br />
<br />
<i>3/3 Excellent on many levels</i><br />
<br />
<b>Q11: Outline further social media strategies to be adopted by VCC (3 marks)</b><br />
<br />
1. <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/villagecc/status/351402818164387840">Tweet </a>celebrities more frequently<br />
2. Set up a VCC Pinterest account.<br />

<b>Q12: Name a man of the match and a Village idiot. Show your workings (5 marks)</b><br />
<br />
Number of fine candidates in each field. MoM: Gupte (good spell,  excellent captaincy), Pitcher (good spell, excellent use of the face  when batting), Potty (excellent innings) - but it goes to Ed Sheeran for  a brilliant all round performance with bat and ball. For future  reference, Villagers may wish to call on <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_redheads">this </a>comprehensive list when in the field.<br />
<br />
Idiot: in the running are AB (contributed basically nothing, another failed captaincy bid),  Pitcher for an expensive drop, De Mellow (comedy dismissal of the year)  but Troja takes it for a 0 and bowling some pies, though excellent live tweeting  should be noted.<br />
<br />
<i>5/5<br />
<br />
Overall: Maths C- (many scoring fails when the extras kicked in), English B+ (more English/British than usual), Drama A*, IT A**, PE D-. Could do better.<br />
