<conditions><p>&nbsp;Terrible.</p> </conditions><p>&nbsp;With the forecast doom ridden, the Village headed south on the vague hope that we&rsquo;d get a game in.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As usual, Southwark and Lambeth opened up with their fine opening pair of Dan and Packer.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Housny responded by doing his David Warner impression, &nbsp;flailing through the covers at will while Ollie did his Paul Collingwood circa 2009 impression. Housny fell quickly to one too many swishes for a useful 25. Ollie was soon put out of his misery to a fine away swinging Yorker. Harty looked solid before letting rip his usual ruthless pursuit of weak bowling, before a moments lapse, in all likelihood due to the disruption caused by the weather interruptions. Thereafter Lukas and Troja both showed some serious class. &nbsp;Troja in particular doing his best Chris Gayle impression taking us to an impressive 254.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After a half time fag break, the Village took the field as yet another storm came over. S&amp;L made a speedy start, despite gutsy bowling from Giles Tupper and Matt Boa. Bowling became increasingly testing &ndash; with the pitch resembling a rugby pitch after the scrum. KP came on and changed the game, delivering a tight and effective spell, to put S&amp;L on the back foot (8 overs 3 for 18).&nbsp; With able support from Ek, the Village were in command. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Yet S&amp;L were far from done, their lower middle made a recovery of sorts, with some good hitting and some flaky Village fielding in testing conditions. Becker ended up on his arse more than he stopped the ball!<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The return of Tupper and Eklavia turned the game, and soon the run rate started looking unmanageable. Things were rounded off with a Matt Boa run out &ndash; bringing back memories of his previous Jonty Rhodes impression running Eklavia out a couple of years ago whilst substitute fielding for the opposition!<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Village retired to the newly gentrified local to eat oven baked pizzas, marvel at the Edwardian come 1980s charisma of the opposition, sing along badly to live music and down repeated jagar bombs. The writer was suffering on Sunday morning&hellip; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">3 out of 3 the reign of Troja appears a golden age.<o:p></o:p></p>
