<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Sunday saw the Village take on Old Whitgiftians at the picturesque Old Whits ground in South Croydon.&nbsp; Keen to avenge a comprehensive defeat last year the Village put out a strong side despite the absence of the Welsh run machine.</span></p>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Continuing his recent good form with the coin skipper Eklavya Gupte won the toss and inserted Old Whits.&nbsp; The pitch was hard but with a green tinge, thus the Villagers hoped for a bit of early assistance.</span> </conditions><p><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>

<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">As is the norm these days, our Kiwi bowling contingent opened our attack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However it wasn&rsquo;t long until the Village was on the back foot with last year&rsquo;s destroyer McGurn dispatching Boa and Bowman to all parts.</span></p>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">After just 6 overs the Louse was introduced to the attack to replace Boa.&nbsp; When the Louse put the ball on the spot he looked very dangerous, however the Louse struggled for consistency and Old Whits punished anything loose. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">After 10 overs Old Whits were 72 without loss. &nbsp;KP was rested and Boa given a change of ends, and with some wind assistance Matty bowled a beautiful inswinging Yorker to dismiss Panchansara for 26. &nbsp;Ekky brought himself into the attack the following over and had an immediate impact claiming an LBW in his first over, and later claimed the key wicket of McGurn caught behind thanks to an excellent catch from Ahmed. &nbsp;Ahmed went on to take an incredible leg side catch off the Louse, and also a brilliant stumping.&nbsp; It was a top class display of keeping!</span></p>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Thereafter Old Whits kept pressing but wickets fell regularly and the score was at 187 when the 10<sup>th</sup> wicket fell in the 38<sup>th</sup> over.</span></p>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">After an excellent afternoon tea openers White and Hindle started our reply.&nbsp; There were some concerns about the 4.5 run per over rate required with two of the Village&rsquo;s most dour defenders at the crease, however those fears were short lived with Hindle showing some uncharacteristic aggression with some lovely lofted drives straight down the ground, and not to be outdone, a majestic cover drive from Bomb clearly shot of the day (for the purists).&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">In the 12<sup>th</sup> over, with the score on 46, Bomb went for a lofted straight drive and got under it.&nbsp; A collision between two fielders looked on the cards, but to the dismay of the Village the catch was taken, and some singing and dancing theatrics ensued. &nbsp;This brought Harty to the wicket who was pleased to seize the opportunity to bat at 3 given the absence of Morgans. &nbsp;He and Hindle started about building a partnership.&nbsp; The change bowlers came on and Hindle struck 12 off Asik's first over.&nbsp; Not to be out done, the ever competitive Harty took 12 off the following over from McGurn, featuring a decent&nbsp; cover drive that went along the ground, proving that he had learnt his lesson from Pacific the previous week.</span></p>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Tarka was looking set to reach his 50, but fell just short, being caught at fly slip for a well made 46. &nbsp;This together with his match winning knock at Pyrford last year, was one of his best knocks for the Village.</span></p>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Areef, the 2 step spinner that destroyed the Village middle order last year, came in to bowl and Harty was quick to take the initiative smashing two sixes to long on to bring up his 50. &nbsp;Adam Simson had joined Harty and immediately looked comfortable and played some lovely shots.</span></p>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">So with 12 overs to go, 44 were required, and Harty (67no) had the calculator out to see if he could manufacture a century.&nbsp; Panchansara came on to bowl and Harty hit the ball for six up the hill into a nearby backyard. &nbsp;After a seeming eternity the ball was declared lost and a replacement found. &nbsp;And that proved his undoing, with Harty top edging a pull shot, and presenting the simplest of catches to the young Asik. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Marrow came in to join Adam and together they knocked off the remaining 40 runs with some quality batting, delivering a 7 wicket victory with 5 overs to spare.</span></p>
<p style="" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Man of the match to Harty for his 73 off just 52 balls, 2 votes to Skipper Eklavya for 3 crucial wickets and his best spell in ages, and 1 very highly deserved vote for Ahmed who kept brilliantly and took the best catch I have ever seen a keeper take standing up to the stumps.</span></p>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Finally thanks to Old Whits for hosting Village again this year. &nbsp;A tremendous game played in great spirit, and we look forward to a game next season.</span>
