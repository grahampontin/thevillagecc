<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="3">Two overs to go, the Village needs 2 runs with 2 wickets remaining.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Tension every where was at fever pitch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Village, after a slow and unsteady innings, surely looked to have secured the game following a couple of well played shots by Bomb.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What followed was a calamity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A beating the likes of which caused every Villager to hang his head in his hands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Wicket, maiden, wicket</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Village loose by 1 run.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With a target of just 116 we had total confidence as we munched on our pizza, sandwiches and clotted cream scones at tea. How had we thrown it all away? </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="3">Before drilling into the gory details of failure, we must acknowledge that there were many positives from our bowling display.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We stated with a fine catch by Potty courtesy of a rebound off his ribs, from some tight and accurate bowling by KP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At the other end, Bomb started a little loosely before finding his range ending with an impressive 1 for 10 off 5.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Village had them three down in no time with a generally tight fielding display.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="3">Then, in what could be seen as the first as many critical incidents in a one run loss, their no.3 Venables played a poor cut without moving his feet to Bomb and it sliced away hard to Morgs&rsquo;s left.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Probably standing too close, he threw a hand at it but he never picked it up and dropped his first of the season.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This proved to be the first escape amongst many for this batsman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He frequently chipped balls before or just over fielders showing an incredible luck that proved to be crucial.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On one occasion, KP having bowled tried to turn himself around but failed to reach one just over his head that gently landed almost alongside the non striker stumps.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="3">Chris mate of Nig and the Louse bowled for half the innings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The oppo put on a few runs, especially against the out of form Chris mate of Nig with some short bowling going down the slope and easily hit through the on-side. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Both went for about 5 &frac12; an over.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Amongst a flurry of fours, batsman got bored awaiting the arrival of Louse&rsquo;s deliveries and played loose shots. A skier to Parp! was well taken but only after a solid partnership between Venables and Meads had developed of about 40 runs. KP securely held one on the long-off boundary rope, then Chris mate of Nig was picked out, taking a fine catch from a long hop at backward square leg&hellip;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, the wickets were tumbling.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="3">The next change saw Ek come on alongside Maj who decided to do his Dave Ireland impression arriving 30 minute late.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Both looked to take advantage of a slopping and turning wicket. Ek returned to form with some &lsquo;<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">good areas&rsquo;</i> while Maj had their lower order all at sea with pace, variation and accuracy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Two catches well caught in the gully off Maj made up for Morgs&rsquo;s earlier drop while Ek made a good stop off his own bowling and quick thinking ran Meads out after an impressive 20.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, they were now 9 down following a majestic Maj slower ball cleaning Wright for 7. Ed Thomas came on to finish them, completing the task in just one ball as the ball was sprayed up to mid-on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Their last 7 wickets had come for around 25 &ndash; all out for 115; including 3 for 2 off 4 overs for Maj.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Village were buoyant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="3">In all likelihood the Village may have showed some hubris.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Especially as their opening bowler, formally clad in a dressed shirt, served up two beamers for Potty to dispatch into the flowerbeds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bizarrely though neither were called by the umpire (Chris mate of Nig) for being a no-ball which, like any small difference, would have been enough for victory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As it turned out both he and his opening bowler partner Castle proceeded to bowl with unerring consistency with a nagging line and length that was difficult to dispatch on the sloping pitch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Potty, clearly with abuse at not having any attacking shots on his mind, and emboldened by those hooks, tried an expansive drive to a ball that was not full enough and too straight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His ill-placed endeavor was rewarded with a ball going through a gaping gate and gutting his stumps.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When chasing such a low score on a difficult wicket the situation was ripe for Potty of old.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Defense and preservation of your wicket was at a premium.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="3">In his place came Teddy T, who, following his one ball bowling spell, batting for just as long.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a true all-rounder he now averages the same (zero) with both bat and ball this season!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Next in was Plimmer who alongside Morgans steadied the ship.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With help from Frank, they kept the pace at 3 &frac12; an over for 10 or so overs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Plimmer was more attacking surviving three Chinese cuts but also relieving pressure with some well played shots through mid off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Morgans was wary, the bowlers were keeping the pressure on and barely played an attacking shot as defense was paramount.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He tried relieving the situation with some expansive running between the wickets almost being run out from a poorly judged 2.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His dive, though impressive, would not have saved him but for the fielder failing to take the bails off when he had the ball in hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="3">At the first change two new bowlers came on as Plimms and Morgs hoped to be able to up the rate to ease the game situation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Yet, some how these bowlers were as good as the first set!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Plimms now playing more aggressively suffered as the ball came down the slope to clean bowl him for 23.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Next out was KP to join an unsteady and still defensive Morgans whose footwork was getting worse and his concentration flagging.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As the heat grew Morgans began to flake; an lbw shout, and a wafting drive were followed by a missed straight one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He played what he thought to be the line but, according to later reports, played inside it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, the ball just clipped the off-stump and he fell for a stodgy, hard-fought 17.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><em>Parp</em>! took his place in the middle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Having done the man&rsquo;s cricket Morgans missed out on the easier bowling to come.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><em><span lang="EN-US"><font size="3">Parp!</font></span></em><span lang="EN-US"><font size="3"> lived up to his previous billing as &ldquo;<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">improved</i>&rdquo; by some nice defensive work and then making hay as the oppo put on their weakest bowlers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Backward cuts were mixed with some genuine edges as Parp pasted OAPs behind square to reach a dashing 23 before edging behind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Wickets kept falling despite the ease in bowling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>KP was strangely subdued and Ek never looked settled playing a flamboyant shot that was well taken at slip.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="3">In all truth the Village failed to score enough during the period of weakest bowling and all Villagers were guilty of playing poor shots and throwing away their wickets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As wickets tumbled the run rate failed to come down, remaining all game at around 3 &frac12; an over.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maj clearly saw an opportunity to up the anti by attacking, well, like a headless chicken.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maj looked like he needed the toilet, so desperate was he to throw away his wicket.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A spawned 2, a drop and several near stumpings preceded Maj&rsquo;s one real connection which flew to long on and&hellip; was easily taken by the one fielder Maj managed to pick out in the deep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Out came Chris mate of Nig to join Bomb.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bomb duly played those earlier mentioned shots to relieve for a moment the pressure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Following one shot, Chris mate of Nig was left on strike for the final ball of the over &ndash; stumps went tumbling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Out came Louse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Over bowled&rdquo;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></i>Surely Bomb, a man strong under pressure, could get runs off the next over off their weakest bowler, a pensionable pie chucker.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></font></span></p>
