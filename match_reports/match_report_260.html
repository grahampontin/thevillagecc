<div>UNBEATEN Village CC delivered a FIVE STAR performance - as they romped to their FIFTH victory of the season.</div>
<div>After a commanding batting performance saw VCC rack up 222 for FIVE, returning bowler Craig Woodhouse weighed in with a FIVE wicket haul to leave the team at FIVE and 0 for the season so far.</div>
<div>The hot streak left ambitious Villagers questioning whether the team can emulate Arsene Wenger's Invincibles and go an entire season unbeaten.</div>
<div>But the latest victory was far from straightforward, with some sensational lower-order hitting keeping Whitgift in with a sniff until a couple of overs from the end.</div>
<div>A remarkable Whitgift victory briefly looked possible before some tight death bowling from Richard Cressey and Toby de Mellow kept the Village juggernaut rolling on.</div>
<div>Cressey (58) had earlier hit an impressive half-century as he and James De Mellow (55) patiently saw off some hostile opening bowling to cash in after the first change for a century opening partnership.</div>
<div>They eventually fell in quick succession, but after stand-in skipper Oliver Morgans was given out LBW, Naz Choudhury (51*) scored his first 50 for three years to help Village to their imposing total.</div>
<div>Choudhury was ably assisted by debutants Prashant Misra (37) and Amshul Varshney (3) - with the latter then impressing as wicket keeper as Whitgift started their chase.</div>
<div>Matt Boa opened the bowling and picked up an LBW wicket as Toby de Mellow ran in with hostility at the other end.</div>
<div>He too secured a scalp when brother James took a screaming one-handed catch down low to his left in the slips.</div>
<div>But Whitgift opener Abilay had amassed 50 as wickets fell at the other end, and was looking dangerous until Woodhouse came on to bowl.</div>
<div>Abilay swept the first ball of his spell - which was sliding down leg - straight to Paul Bowman at short fine leg who took a catch which almost matched de Mellow's screaming slipper.</div>
<div>That triggered chaos, as wobbly flight and late dip delivered two stumpings thanks to quick work by Varshney and two more balls hit the stumps to secure Woodhouse his THIRD career Village five-fer - level with Boa in VCC history.</div>
<div>Woodhouse's spell also brought a run-out thanks to a great throw by Bowman, but ended as newly-elected Labour councillor Mann and new batsman Hooper started a late-innings onslaught.</div>
<div>Three big-hitting overs suggested Whitgift could yet secure the most unlikely of victories as Mann ignored some politically-charged sledging.</div>
<div>But Cressey and the returning de Mellow had other ideas, and tight death bowling even left Mann stranded on 49 not out.</div>
<div>With that, Village were able to celebrate five of the best - and start dreaming about the perfect season.</div>
