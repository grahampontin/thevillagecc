<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">Captain Troj continued his lucky charm with the flipping coins and the Village decided to bat first. The makeshift openers WLD and EK confidently dragged themselves onto the crease. EK played like the best opener in the world, before getting bowled to a straight ball, not reflecting how well he played. WLD (unmoved by stories about him puking in the office at the thought of opening), courageously played, missed, jabbed before getting out for 4, earned thankfully through a misfield. It looked like the uncovered pitch had demons in it. The Village were once again off to a rollicking start.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">Steve Harty strode onto the crease at 3 and looked solid from the start. Ben &ldquo;The bearded explorer/adventurer/conqueror&rdquo; Hampton joined him and the two of them played some exquisite shots. Harty, in the process of batting, scaled the Everest of 3,000 runs for Village when he reached 23. The Villagers accorded a standing ovation full of nothing but reverence. Harty though soon got out for 34. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">Captain Troj joined Ben in the middle and looked in breathtaking touch and in particularly destructive mood right from the start. The two of them started threading the bowling to all parts putting the rest of us at ease. The partnership, though, was cut short when Troj was given out LBW to a ball, that probably looked a touch too high to the naked eye; and (perhaps) impacted the end score by about 30/40 runs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">Ben, now joined by Bosh, continued to smoke the bowling like a man possessed. Ben eventually got out for 58, having played his best innings in a long time. Contributions from Bosh, Abrar, Naz and KP took us to 227.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">The Villagers were served a delightful platter by the OWCC and we all ate like bottomless walking bins. Special thanks goes to OWCC for serving a wonderful tea.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">The Village started their defence with some terrific bowling from Thomo, who knocked over a couple quickly, ably supported by Naz, who took two and EK one. Captain Troj was in fine &ldquo;cunning&rdquo; form - catches and balls going to where he moved the field. It could have been six down, when a ball went so high, that Cressey could have driven villagers (with his &ldquo;beloved&rdquo; Taylor Swift) to Mars for a concert, and came back. Destiny would have it otherwise with both Cressey and the ball. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">At drinks, OWCC were 5 down for 80 odd. Ayub and Schad at the crease and 140 odd needed off 20 overs and Villagers bowling and fielding at their best. Captain Troj introduced Pitcher into the attack, who took two in his first over. It reminded him that Malta wasn&rsquo;t a one off memory to be cherished and affirmed that bowling in the nets with non-existent batsman has merits. Another mini collapse, leaving OWCC 9 down with another 80 odd needed. Ayub though was playing well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">Troj went on the offensive and brought Thomo back. The moment arrived when all villagers, having thought they heard the knick, rushed in from all corners and celebrated with unbridled gusto, only to see the umpire not raising any crooked/straight finger. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">The match was closed when Ayub got bowled - off a no-ball and the ball rushed towards the boundary, earning OWCC a one wicket victory, graciously accepted by the Village. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">The day ended with many pints, several conversations, few executive indecisions, one eavesdropping, a lot of resolve and all hungry Villagers. The strength of character still compact.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
