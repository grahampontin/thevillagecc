<div class=report_title>Match Report</div>
<p><font face="Arial">With the third day of the Lords test meandering from one Steve Bucknor inspired bad light reading to the next, The Village CC assembled a team at Parliament Hill pumped and ready to take on the St Anne's Allstars. Well, part of a team, demotion down the batting line-up the fate waiting for the late arriving Hanson and Ireland.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">A walk to the middle found the day's light rain and drizzle making little impression on the bouncy but well-tilted pitch, but an outfield sodden with freshly cut grass. As is the custom the toss came next with El-Cap ending his poor early season form with a win and sending the Allstars out to field.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Villagers Pontin and Thomas were first out, but strangely both seeming to have misplaced (hidden) their usual blades due to the continuing drizzle. Doubts about the bats were soon dispelled as both laid waste to the opening bowlers &ndash; almost Villager Hampton and his partner, who bore more than a passing resemblance to Sergio's favourite Tory, Alan Duncan MP. Both bowlers saw their opening delivery sent crashing through the downhill boundary by Pontin, setting the scene for what was to come. Not to be out-done, Thomas also helped himself to the boundaries, sending the bad balls down the hill and over the rope.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">8 overs down, the 50 was up in good time, and the Allstars made a double change bringing on the slow bowlers in an effort to stem the runs. And stem the runs they did with only 24 runs coming off the next 8 overs, but it wasn't enough to prevent Pontin bringing up his first fifty of the season. Even Prep's suspicious leg-bye call on what should have been the milestone run couldn't overshadow the Scot's pugnacious innings.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Pontin's retirement bought Village stalwart Richardson to the crease eager to plunder the bowling on offer. Fresh from bigging himself up on the Guestbook the previous day, the Chief was soon off the mark with a ferocious pull down the hill and almost through the fence. A couple more boundaries followed before the Allstars made their first breakthrough, Richardson's stumps broken by Allen junior. All the while Thomas was anchoring the innings from the other end a'la Bomb, turning the strike over with an early single off each over.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Richardson's demise saw Lucarotti stride out, fresh from dispatching Sibo to every corner of the nearby practise net. And what a warm-up it must have been, as a classic Luca innings ensued as he took it upon himself to smash the life out of both the ball and the tiring bowlers. Sixes and fours flowed with ease the only halt to the onslaught came when the ball was missiled out of the ground. It wasn't to last thou and the Allstar's Kiwi ringer Doyle slipped a straight one in and castled Luca with his maiden fifty in sight.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Not to be outdone, Thomas raised his fifty sending the massed crowds into raptures. Job done Thomas retired and KP headed out to the crease to join Marrow, and two balls later was on his way back to the sidelines having been run out dawdling down the pitch.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">With three overs left Matt and Marrow helped themselves at more than 10 an over, Marrow treating everyone to a brief glimpse of his reverse pull, and bringing up the 200 before closing out the innings at 212.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Alas the rain that had plaguing the test on the other side of Regents Park made an unwelcome appearance during the tea interval leaving most wondering if the second innings would start. Ever the optimists, the Village kept themselves warm attempting to kick round a football and leaving none of the crowd in any doubt why cricket is their first 'sport'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Eventually thou the rain abated and the Allstars came out needing over 6 runs and over. With one of their players having to head home at the break, and the batting creases starting to resemble a mud bath, the required run rate would prove to be too much. Sibo started the wicket procession off, cleaning up two sets of stumps before ending his short spell. KP sent another back also cleaned bowled, and the Allstars were deep trouble.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Richardson was next up with the ball, and after a few life threatening beamers out of the way the opposition skipper decided it was time for the light to be questioned. Thankfully the light meter was safely tucked away in Bucknor's trousers at Lords and the game continued. A full pitched delivery saw Richardson send McKinnon back to the sidelines at the end of his spell.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">With the light in question the slow bowlers were bought on, Pontin from the school end and Marrow at the Heath end. Pie-Master Pontin obligingly opened the bakery counter for business mostly delivering his bland meat pies. However a fiery chilli special had the dangerous looking Doyle out caught and bowled, probably taking the catch of the season in the process.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Marrow joined in, tempting Stephenson to loop a catch up to Sibo at cover. This bought last man and Allstars skipper Allen to the crease, but he wasn't to last as grenade launcher Lucarotti pulled the pin and exploded one all over the oppo skipper's off stump. Alan Duncan MP left standing at the other end not out.</font></p>
<p>With a win in excess of 150 runs, there are no shortage of Man of the Match contenders. Twin fifties for the openers is usually a compelling case for an award. Today thou it is a tie. Lucarotti for his bludgeoning batting, match ending wicket, and inspirational pastry based banter in the field. The assembled WAGs jointly taking the award for a sensational WAGing display despite the inclement weather.</p>
<p>Village Idiot much more clear cut - KP for his idiotic run out.</p>
