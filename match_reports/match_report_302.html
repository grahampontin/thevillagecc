<p>&nbsp;</p> </conditions>Village CC pulled off their first victory against the Hobgoblin Nomads since 2012 in another low scoring battle at Hilly Fields Park.

After losing the toss on a good looking wicket, captain Troja gave the new ball to Thomo and Ben who proceeded to take 3 wickets in the first 4 overs courtesy of some high quality seam and swing bowling and a nonchalant, one-handed catch at gully by Morgs. Top grab, made to look bizarrely easy, but unfortunately for him not the best of the day. A short rebuilding period followed, led by Hobgoblin Lynch who drove confidently and successfully, until one pinged right out of the middle and appeared to be heading for the boundary only for TdM to leap salmon-like, high and to his left to pluck the ball out from the air space behind him. After a Flintoff/Christ-esq celebration led to a pile-on, the Village was able to reflect that they had indeed witnessed catch of the season and something truly special. Well done TdM and in the words of Jason Statham, remember…you are not a salmon (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS_K61mEKdo). 

With the overs spread around between the first four bowlers, Bilal chipped in with a n extremely tight 3-7 off 5 and EK equalled KP’s record of 34 wickets in a season with two tail end wickets. But the tone for the season’s best all round fielding display was really set by Thomo’s 2-11 and Ben’s 2-27 at the top of the order (4 dropped catches aside?!).

Hobgoblins finished with 84 off 21 overs leaving the Village with a low chase and the prospect of an early trip to the pub.  The inning started slowly however with some tight bowling from Nomadic opening bowlers Rana and Jackson. JdM started the more positive of the Village’s opener knocking two boundaries before being caught at cover to ball he should have either waited for or followed through with. Other opener Cressey and number 3 Abbas took advantage of the low total by eating up over after over, scoring mainly off extras before both were knocked over by Jackson. After these departures, and the introduction of the change bowlers, the chase was quickly put to bed by the two star catchers from earlier in the day with Morgs and TdM combining to see home the Village yet again. Until TdM came to the crease, there was a distinct chance that Frank would top score for the Village in another solid performance from the veteran of 200+ matches.

With the game finished before 5pm, the Village had a solid game of one-hand, one-bounce on the square with EK proving he has hard hands as well as hard knees and Troja head-butting Bosh to leave the man from Lucknow with a bloodied forehead. Massive session in the Royal Albert ended with Ubers galore, Troja in Harlesden after falling asleep on the Bakerloo and Morgs seeing his rabbit again (note not the Black Prince) in the toilet bowl the next day. 

1 game to go in the Troja captaincy. Let's make it a big win against the Beamers next week and see the season out in style!
