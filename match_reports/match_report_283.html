<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Fresh from waving Heath off into the sunset following last week&rsquo;s narrow* loss to Southwark and Lambeth CC, we regrouped to face London Fields at a sun-kissed Parliament Hill. This was a fixture long in the making as last year&rsquo;s game succumbed to a biblical August downpour. So, having eyed each other up for the last two winters during hazy Sunday morning net sessions, Super Sunday had arrived and it didn&rsquo;t disappoint. Pre-match chat revolved around the latest instalment of Thomo&rsquo;s &lsquo;new look&rsquo;. The Villain arrived sporting a snazzy pair of black Nike trainers together with his new skinny jeans which he had previously showcased against Pecos XI a fortnight prior. As has been noted in these pages, Gem Gem appears to be changing her man. Viva, Gem Gem!<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Returning skipper Torj won the toss and elected to bat on a green but hard wicket which appeared to offer something to both batsmen and bowler. JdM and Cressey strode to the crease watched by the proud creators of The Gorgeous One (&lsquo;TGO&rsquo;) who were down for the weekend from the Midlands. Unfortunately for Mr and Mrs Cressey their son fell early slapping one to somewhere in the point/gully region (?!) after looking characteristically solid. JdM proceeded to get on the front foot and be positive. This approach culminated in two crisp boundaries and a big six off the back foot over cover which was caught (one handed!) by a spectator who crashed into a bin in the process. But alas disaster then struck as JdM was bowled by one which kept low from half way up the pitch. &nbsp;Fields smelt blood and it was Bosh who perished next departing first ball to a delivery which can only be described as filth. WLD (in a chipper mood following a weekend of smooching, papers in the park and Ghandi &ndash; it just sounded like a classic weekend) and Torj set about undertaking the rebuilding job until WLD charged down the wicket and got bowled. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Torj was then joined by TdM at no.6 and together they started to get the scoreboard ticking along at a decent rate and navigating what was turning out to be a tricky pitch. Torj was looking in imperious form but, after notching up an excellent fifty, he misjudged one from Tony and fell LBW. EK then came and went looking glorious in the process. What a back lift, what style, what a player. Next in was Bossy who set about demonstrating the kind of hitting that one can imagine Thomo showcased when he was in his twenties. TdM fell stumped for 79 trying to push things along whilst Bossy continued the fireworks with three big sixes (one clearing the school by some distance). Thomo also joined the party by plundering a mighty six and chipping in with a quick fire 16 not out. Bossy ended stranded on a powerful 44 red inker which helped the hosts, in his first innings for VCC, post a daunting 264 for 7 off 40 overs. There were rumours circulating that this was the highest total ever posted at Parliament Hill. Ever. Good luck, Fields. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Against the sound of the London Gay Symphonic Winds (resident for the afternoon on the Parliament Hill bandstand) Thomo and Bossy set about making some early inroads. Both bowled with encouraging pace from the off and it was World Cup winner Alan Ball who made the breakthrough earliest when he forced the no.2 into a false drive which fizzed into the safe hands of TGO at point. Bossy cranked up the pace and found his lengths and soon did for the handy McCrindle. This was just a lovely piece of cricket with the ball forcing the batsmen to edge Bossy at a speed to JdM who caught well at gully. A thing of beauty, that. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Louse (making his long awaited first appearance of the season) and TdM replaced the openers and continued to exert the same degree of pressure by bowling well in tandem. It was as if Louse had never been away as he proceeded to tempt Field&rsquo;s skipper into (in this Villager&rsquo;s humble opinion) one terrible shot too many as he hauled out to Thomo at mid-on. With the skipper gone TdM was provided with the chance to have a bowl at the dangerman Taz Miller. On the stroke of drinks the left armer got one to rise and forced Miller to glove behind to WLD. Big celebrations were had as Miller trudged off. Following the drinks break Louse hungrily gobbled up two more wickets. Of note was his wicket of no.5 Worthy who was sporting a long sleeve shirt/jumper combo in the sweltering heat. Whether it was the humidity or the nous of the Louse, Mr Westminster tempted Worthy into a big stroke and he was sharply caught by JdM at short midwicket. Pitcher was unfortunate not to pick up a wicket that his tight bowling deserved whilst EK mopped up the tail in customary fashion bagging 2 for 1 off 2. Due to injury and other commitments, Fields only batted until no.9 so that was that. Victory!<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We merrily trotted down the hill to enjoy a couple of &lsquo;cheeky&rsquo; Sunday night drinks at the Vine. A solid session of 5% lager ensued which suitably toasted an enjoyable team win. Well done, Village. <o:p></o:p></p>
