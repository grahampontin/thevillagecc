<p>Raynes Park dealt Village the knockout blow in a punchy encounter which TWICE threatened to break out into a mass brawl.</p>
<p>At one point former VCC captain Eklavya Gupte even urged for the match to be abandoned amid ugly scenes in the middle.</p>
<p>It might have been better for the Village if it had been called off - as they slumped to a massive seven wicket defeat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the result will be forgotten long before the memories of raised bats and a pitch invasion by Raynes Park players fade away.</p>
<p>The trouble came out of the blue after Village had posted 172-8 thanks to an epic hundred-run stand between Gupte (55*) and Thompson which saved their innings from disaster after a string of failures.</p>
<p>As Raynes Park began their chase, opener Ikram flashed at a wide one from Hampton which was safely snaffled by Troja behind the stumps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But a nick so loud and obvious it could be heard and seen from space was somehow missed by both umpires and the Raynes Park captain at the non-striker's end.</p>
<p>Despite pleading from Villagers, Ikram refused to walk and then smashed Hampton for a couple of boundaries amid viscious sledging from the slip cordon.</p>
<p>As an angry Hampton applauded sarcastically, Ikram took issue and marched towards the bowler with his bat raised - sparking the first confrontation.</p>
<p>Hampton was hauled out of the attack and Ikram fell to replacement Woodhouse in short order - slapping a wide one to Misra at point.</p>
<p>As the bowler checked with the umpire to make sure Ikram had hit it, Misra issued his own foul-mouthed send off which angered the batsman who again came charging over with his bat raised.</p>
<p>Raynes Park players watching from the idyllic Chiswick House pavilion also rushed on to get a piece of the action as the match threatened to turn from cricket to armed combat.</p>
<p>Once things calmed down it was clear Village had been put off their rhythm, with dropped catches and wayward bowling allowing captain Rose (70), supported by Imran (40) and Taz (35*), to knock off the runs with ease.</p>
<p>After the game there was only one talking point - and it wasn't the cricket.</p>
