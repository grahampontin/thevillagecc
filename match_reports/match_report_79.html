<div class=report_title>Match Report</div>
<div>The words &quot;Wiltshire Tour&quot; are associated with many things: Cider, Skittles but not oft of late Sunshine. This year the weather gods decided it was high time to cut us a break and bestow upon the West Country what will probably be the best weekend of the summer.</div>
<div></div>
<div>As has become traditional, our tale begins on Friday afternoon, The Village's members making their variously (un)believable excuses to knock off work early, beat the traffic out of the big smoke and onwards to the welcoming bosom of 250, The Common, Holt. For once your author doesn't have to&nbsp;fill too many pixels recounting stories of mud slides onto the M4, breakdowns and near bladder-rupturings, and can&nbsp;merely&nbsp;recount that the touring party arrived on time and in good order, assembling at the Tuckers Grave for an evening of Skittles and Cider-induced madness, after&nbsp;a short interlude to pick up this year's special bus.</div>
<div></div>
<div>And so the first great sporting endeavour of the weekend got under way, 16 Villagers and WAGAHOs splitting themselves into Giants and Dwarfs and making ready to compete for Sausage Cup 2008.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Last year&rsquo;s defending champion, Page, started poorly, opening the door for one-time-winner Rahilly, all-round-sporting-hero-and-generally-great-guy Marrow and WAG-representative Rainford to enter into the contest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>And what a contest it was. Six ends of skittles later Rainford had a slender lead, Rahilly and Marrow were sniffing at her heels and Plimmer had passed out on the lawn, the cider having taken its toll on Saturday&rsquo;s designated driver.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Rainford failed to close the deal &ndash; a disappointing five from her final throw giving hope to the chasing pack. And so to Rahilly, needing just seven skittles to regain his crown of 2006, he struck big and early &ndash; five down with his first ball. The scent of victory was in the air and Rahilly was looking hungry. His second though was poor, a dot ball, leaving him just one delivery and two pins for a near certain victory. A second dot ball on the bounce was not what the doctor ordered, Rahilly collapsing onto the track in anguish, spread-eagled and pounding his fists in dismay. Marrow&rsquo;s fire by this stage seemed to have been doused by a healthy measure of cider and his final throw didn&rsquo;t threaten a now triumphant Rainford: Sausage Cup Champion 2008.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A few more ciders were drunk, Plims was rescued from the lawn and the Villagers wound their merry way home, 250 The Common as ever bearing the brunt of the lodging duties.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Next morning a somewhat the worse for wear group of cricketers could be seen assembling at the White Horse, Compton Basset, home of crop circle title-tattle and a rather fetching hill side carving from which the pub, one must presume, took its name. Food was eaten, boule was played, silly hats were compared and Plims was once again found lying on the lawn, the previous night&rsquo;s exertions still weighing heavily upon him.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Lunch done and dusted it was a short trip down the road to the home of Compton Basset CC, a fine looking cricket pitch nestled at the bottom of a hill and location of one of the mostly heavily cow pat laden field-come-car-parks in the western world. Kit was unpacked, excrement dodged with varying degrees of success and teams decided &ndash; Page, Andy and Bomb choosing to bat for the other team in an effort to bolster a Friars line-up which has never really recovered from the loss of Randy Theodolite.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Make no mistake about it, it was HOT, the inside of the changing rooms achieving temperatures usually only experienced by sauna goers who have had the misfortune to collide with an enthusiastic Swede. It was a day to win the toss and bat. It would not be misleading to say that KP&rsquo;s form with the coin this year has been abysmal, but for once he came through, the toss was won and Plims and PARP! were dispatched to open the innings.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Bomb and Andy took the new ball for the Friars, hoping to make early inroads. PARP!&rsquo;s doughty defence though did it&rsquo;s job, absorbing the early onslaught until he was finally undone by Bomb &ndash; trapped plumb in front. And so to the crease walked Marrow a few more uneventful overs passed and A-Rich was replaced by Len from the Tractor End. If ever the word &quot;wily&quot; was apt to describe a bowler it was now. Subtle changes of pace, cutters and intelligent use of a pitch offering movement down the slope and uneven bounce made life difficult for the batsmen, Plims eventually falling LBW to one that perhaps kept a little low.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In at four was Pontin, a man who has a history of making runs on tour, looking once again to bolster a disappointing season run tally. &ldquo;Be careful of this chap&rdquo; were Marrow&rsquo;s words of advice, &ldquo;Get forward&rdquo;. They were, of course, ignored and only the thinnest of inside edges saved the new batsman from a first ball duck.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Scoring has been tough and by this point your author would estimate the score was around 20-2 but he could be wrong. At any rate, Marrow and Pontin made steady progress, guiding the good ship Village towards the respectability of 3 figures. The scoring rate was helped somewhat by the introduction of Tupper from the Cow Pat end and the rather strange decision to bowl right-arm-round to the predominantly leg-sided stroke play of Pontin. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The demise of Marrow (20 odd I suppose) escapes my recollection, but fall he did. Rahilly then took to the wicket sporting a rather jaunty sailor&rsquo;s hat, was instructed to respect the bowling of Len, and promptly dispatched him over mid-on for a one-bounce four.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Cue that moment that every Villager loves and loathes in equal measure. The introduction of Page to replace Tupper bringing both the opportunity to make runs and the peril of having b. Page on your batting CV. Sadly for Rahilly it was to be the second option, Page finding the ideal spot to generate a lethal off stump pea-roller, but not before Rahilly (10ish) had reached double figures and dispatched Len over backwards square leg for one of the shots of the day.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Out strode an confident looking, alice-band sporting Woodlouse to face the music which by this point was being played by Andy from the Cow Pat end and a Minor from the Tractor End.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Louse(some) didn&rsquo;t hang around too long, it was time to push the scoring rate and look for a declaration, and he was given LBW to the minor despite his protestations about having hit it. Next up: Saul.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A nudged single here and a run or two there followed but taking runs off Andy was proving tricky. Pontin looked to play some big shots against the minor and was finally bowled for 35 ish, dragging the ball back onto his stump while trying to execute an agricultural looking heave. From this point onwards your humble wordsmith&rsquo;s memory is a little vague. Bomb had his wish and dismissed Fudge who played a brief cameo, KP probably missed a straight one and The Village declared on about 130. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Time for tea then, the Friars laying on a delightful selection of sandwiches and a wide-ranging selection of booze.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Fed, watered and raring to go, the Village took to the field with about 30 overs to attempt to dismiss the Friars / defend their lead.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Bomb and the previously mentioned Minor took to the wicket, and KP and Damon the somewhat scuffed and dull ball. KP started tidily to A-Bomb, a leg bye the only blemish on the opening over.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Said bye sent Bomb to the other end to face Wake who was hoping his rader would be better tuned than it has been a Millfields a week before. To say it was tuned was an understatement; Bomb sent packing for a duck courtesy of an in-swinging yorker that would have unseated many a batsman so early in his innings. &quot;The last place I was expecting him to bowl was at the stumps&quot; complained a disgruntled A-Bomb.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Cometh the hour, cometh the Page. But&nbsp;a few defensive prods later and he was also gone, chopping a ball through the sluggish hands of substitute fielder Sandy in the gully&nbsp;then compounding the error by returning for a suicidal second run only to find the bails whipped off by PARP!. Shorty thereafter PARP! did himself less proud with a wildly over enthusiastic celebration of the dismissal of the Minor, bowled by KP.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Three down and the Friars were in all sorts of trouble. Andy was at the crease with Tupper to attempt a rescue job. But it wasn&rsquo;t to be, Andy&rsquo;s batting form (last seen circa May 2007) once again deserting him, playing-on to a Wake long hop.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Tupper proved rather more troublesome, a few lusty blows off the first change duo of Louse and Saul and there was a glimmer of hope for the Friars. KP then chose to call on the left-arm wrist spin of TJ &ldquo;The Pendulum&rdquo; Rahilly. To say Tupper did not respect Rahilly&rsquo;s offerings would be an understatement. The Friar switching hands a la Pietersen and effecting his agricultural brand of batting in reverse. It was to be Rahilly who had the last laugh though - a combination of spin and slope doing enough to beat the batsman&rsquo;s flailing blade and bowl him for a creditable 20ish. The writing was on the wall. Marrow, Pontin and Plimmer were enlisted to clean up the tail and they duely deliverd, Plims taking the final wicket, caught KP at mid-off, with but a couple of overs remaining in the day.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A fabulous game of cricket was at an end. The gathering of men, women and children packed themselves into their cars and made tracks towards the Bell on the Common for grilled meat, booze and pool. And what better way to prepare for the exertions of the next day, Keevil CC.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Man of the Match: PD Wake &ndash; A devastating spell with the new ball that was ultimately the difference between the sides. </div>
