<p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small;">Hampstead Heath Extension, it's fair to say, is not one of our finest venues. While it's picturesque enough, it's somewhat bereft of facilities, lacking a pavilion, toilets, boundary rope or indeed a wicket worthy of the name. It's the venue to which a fixtures secretary turns when every other option has been exhausted. For sheer &quot;Oh God, not there&quot; factor, surely only the long-forgotten nuclear waste land of Low Hall Farm comes close.</span></p>

<div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small;">Our opponents for the day, Marlow Park, who by all accounts play at a proper ground, were somewhat bemused by the sight of six stumps seemingly plunged into the ground at a random spot towards the top of the meadow. The toss was had, and while I can't remember who won, the choice must have been at once simple and complex. Batting would be very difficult all day - but did that make it better to do it first or second? Someone decided the VCC should have first dig.</div>

<div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small;">A word on our team. It was deeply reminiscent of a 90s England team (and had about as many actual English people in it). Everyone could bat a bit, pretty much, and everyone could bowl a bit too. What order was captain Troja to stick them in? His random number generator threw out KP and AB to open, and the pair started well, putting away anything short and keeping out anything on a good length. The bounce was irregular, the swing and seam prodigious, but the pitch, mercifully, was rain soaked and slow.</div>
<div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small;">After a decent start, KP was first to go, caught behind off the inside edge as Marlow Park's off spinner got one to bite. AB swiftly followed, a ball rearing off a length, taking the shoulder of the bat before being pouched one-handed by the keeper. It was the pitch's wicket, and would hardly be the last to go &quot;bowled extension&quot; by the end of the day.</div>
<div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small;">Bird and Hussain now began to put on an elegant partnership - Bilal's bottom-hand heavy game looked particularly suited to the conditions - but like the openers they too disappeared after looking comfortable. Bilal put in a strong contender for Village Idiot by attempting to pull a slow long hop, missing, and watching the ball plop onto his stumps. I'm afraid your reporter was probably tweeting about the game when Bird went so I don't know what happened to him.</div>

<div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small;">Tang's early season form hasn't been great, and this was hardly the place for him to rediscover it: he soon went bowled through the gate by one from left arm spin/cutter Chandra, who looked the most threatening bowler. On the plus side, this gave him the chance to contemplate edits to this month's magnus opus for Cricinfo.</div>
<div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small;">Odlum became the second victim of the pitch - the debutant certainly looked like he could play, but another one ramped off a length and gave us an action replay of AB's dismissal. Troja quickly departed too, after missing a full toss in front of his stumps. However, the VCC weren't overly disturbed - as previously discussed, the batting ability didn't exactly diminish with the fall of wickets: could Kiwis Glenn and Bun defy national stereotypes and put a partnership together?&nbsp;</div>
<div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small;">The answer initially was yes, only for Bun to have another ball rear up on him, which he fended to a catcher on the leg side. The next kiwi to the crease, #Boa2014, had looked extremely comfortable during a long net session, which meant only one result was likely: sure enough, he fished at his first ball and bagged his first ever golden duck. C-Pitch saw out the hat trick ball, but Maroney clearly didn't like the look of what he saw, charged the spinner and lost his middle stump.</div>
<div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small;">It was hard to know if we'd batted well or not. Three batsmen couldn't really be blamed for their dismissals and scoring for the others looked very hard, but only one batsman had managed to get past 30.</div>
<div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small;">The Marlow response perhaps answered this question. Chandra played some lovely off side drives off an increasingly hot cross Bun, and Turner looked classy for his 27, but aside from that no batsman looked like making an impression in conditions that were clearly alien to them. As the innings was short, it's only right this bit of the report is too - Bun found his line and length after an expensive start and was unlucky not to bag five, and he was expertly backed up by some disconcerting pace from Maloney and teasing dibble and dobble from Tang and Pitch. The fact all but one batsmen were bowled or LBW tells you pretty much all you need to know.</div>
<div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial; font-size: small;">The game was up quickly, which meant we got to the pub quickly, and this WAS definitely a good thing. Village idiot is rather difficult despite a late bid from KP with some Marble Arch esque ground fielding, so that has to go to the groundsman/gardener, and MoM is a close one between Bun and Glen for dismantling the batting - Bun just shades it for top order wickets.</div>
