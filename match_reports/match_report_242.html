<conditions><p>August was clearly over. Marshy, the smell of the river. Dangerous geese. Thieves in the area.&nbsp;</p> </conditions><p>&nbsp;A tale of 13 wickets:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1: JdM, ct for 0<br />
Over one, a Trott/Jaques/Boof hybrid opens up from the football end. Jdm has a loose swipe at a wideish one fourth ball, sits in the hands of point after a bit of a juggle. JdM's day over before 1.05pm</p>
<p>2: Hot Crossed Bun, ct for 0<br />
The following over &ndash; well done, openers!&nbsp;</p>
<p>3: WLD: 41<br />
Captain Morgan and me Harty rebuilt things with pleasantly piratey partnership. Some impressive controlled hitting from both saw the village regain their momentum until one nicked back and clipped the captain's bail. There was a small controversy about wides, but none of the parties involved let it fester and the issue wasn't brought up again for the rest of the day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4: me harty: 58<br />
Harty not on peak Harty form, but sill comfortable, launches one to long on. Agricola fielder doesn't get the memo about what usually happens in these situations and the Aussie goes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5: Kris Bird<br />
Bird and Naz do some brief rebuilding until KB has a bit of a swipe (I think) and is bowled</p>
<p>6: EK: ct for 0<br />
EK hits his first ball oh-so-stylishly straight to cover</p>
<p>7: C-Pitch: ct for 0<br />
Can't remember much about this, sorry Pitch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>8: Naz: stumped for 9<br />
Meanwhile, Naz is working himself into a tizz by not smashing the spinner to cow...this ends in the time-honoured fashion</p>
<p>9: Boa, lbw 7<br />
After receiving an thorough warm up (Marie's throw-downs were unerringly accurate &ndash; she's done this before). Boa smacks one down the ground for four, before padding up to an enthusiastic finger from morgs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>10: DI, ct 10<br />
Golf's David Ireland played his strokes nicely while most of this was going on and was eventually joined by the Louse, before holing out on the last ball of the innings. Village 154 all out. Defendable, we thought: big boudaries, slow outfield.&nbsp;</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>11: Boa! After a first over six, Matty gets Ugly Opener to whack one in the air to mid-off, where ball magnet Chris Pitcher gets his safe hands out</p>
<p>12: Ireland! The other opener hung around a little longer, before hitting the impressive Mav to EK at cover</p>
<p>13: Louse... between 12 and 13, the game was pretty much lost. Their number three, Joint, hit the ball clean and straight (he also took 1-15 off eight*) and the fight went out of the village a little bit. Pitch did well to get to one chance, but the ball popped out of his outstretched hand. It was a 20% chance. Although Louse picked up another wicket in the deep, Village were out of it by about 15 overs and Joint wrapped things up in the 23rd, finishing on 106 not out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* ADD FIFTEEN TO THIS FOR ALL THE WIDES<br />
