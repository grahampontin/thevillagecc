<p class="MsoNormal">All too often, match reports endeavour to record the detail of the contest without capturing the real essence of the affair.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Not today.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you really care about the numbers, look below, come to the (correct) conclusion that this was an entertaining game and then disappear back to the cricinfo website to see how many wickets Phil Defreitas took in the 1994 Ashes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To anybody who is left, consider this: 16 people put themselves forward to be part of this fixture. The Village is clearly in rude health. Long may this continue.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Essential village elements to take from the match:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul type="disc" style="margin-top:0cm">
    <li style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt" class="MsoNormal">A      villager ending up in hospital as a result of some over-enthusiastic      wicket-keeping. Blame it on the (C) Pitch, they said. We did. That      troublesome digit certainly won&rsquo;t be furiously triggering anybody for a      few weeks.</li>
    <li style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt" class="MsoNormal">Comedy      fielding from the Louse, who had sportingly entered the contest in a pair      of jeans and some deck shoes as a pitch-side replacement.</li>
    <li style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt" class="MsoNormal">Captain      Gupte sportingly ensuring the opposition some further runs by keeping the      Trevor Kavanagh heir-apparent slipping and sliding on the boundary.</li>
    <li style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt" class="MsoNormal">Morgans      nonchalantly arriving at the game 90 minutes late in a pair of obscenely      revealing shorts and one of Me Harty&rsquo;s old work shirts.</li>
    <li style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt" class="MsoNormal">A      pea-roller dismissing one-time villager (and current Miami-vice) Troja.</li>
    <li style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt" class="MsoNormal">Some      extraordinary catching (and attempts at catching) from the Risen Christ      and J De Mellow Magic.</li>
    <li style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt" class="MsoNormal">A      good effort at throwing away the game by a collapsing Village middle order.</li>
    <li style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt" class="MsoNormal">The      real sense that the Kiwis within the Village were more concerned about the      Black Caps not getting past the line against Sri Lanka than the same      predicament playing out at the same time on Parliament Hill.</li>
    <li style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt" class="MsoNormal">A      comedy run-out involving a slip, a drop of the bat and a desperate crawl      by the peerless Lucarotti.</li>
    <li style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt" class="MsoNormal">All      of the above played out to the continuous curious soundtrack provided by      an apparently invisible Irish/Country and Western band (and I use the word      &lsquo;band&rsquo; loosely) blaring out such cricket-friendly numbers as &lsquo;I saw her      standing there&rsquo; and &lsquo;Hallelujah&rsquo; <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Anyway. Victory was claimed. Backs were patted and the familiar trudge down Highgate Road to the Vine began. I should say that the now customary pause at the Bull and Last to check that they are not receptive to an influx of 20 thirsty cricketers was immaculately observed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Man of the Match - Boa, but he was run close by some crucial work with the bat and ball by Nick 'I look a bit like Jonny Bairstow' Thomson and The Example. Me Harty was also a candidate before losing his wicket to the Trojan.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Village Idiot - Morgans. Two words: Those shorts.</p>
