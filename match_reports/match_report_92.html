<div class=report_title>Match Report</div>
The Village had opened the season by being absolutely trounced by these fellas. We knew certain things about them, to whit 1) They had batsmen who hit it a VERY long way 2) Their home was an astroturf pitch on a ground about the size of a small allotment 3) As a result&nbsp; of 1) and 2) they didn't really bother with bowlers.<br />
<br />
But this time round we were playing them at bowlers' haven the Rec - would it be a different story? Captain For The Day Bomb went out and as per usual lost the toss. The Pacific captain, their danger man, elected to bat, perhaps knowing that an already dry pitch would deteriorate through the game.<br />
<br />
Pleasantries over, and so to business.&nbsp; At the start of the season Pacific had absolutely slammed an under prepared Bomb all over North London. But this was a different character they were facing, a ripened Bomb of mid-season vintage in fine form and fettle. In his first couple of overs he removed their opener with an (even) slower ball that crept under his mistimed drive and for good measure trapped the other bang in front with an inswinger. Two down, but he wasn't done there - their dangerous number four was removed by an absolute pearler that shaped away from his leg stump and clipped his back pad in front of off. Bomb was single handedly destroying one of the best batting line ups in North London friendly cricket. How much more damage could he inflict?<br />
<br />
Not much more was the answer, for he decided to take a spell. No wonder, for their captain was in, and starting to hit some sweet boundaries. Saul had taken over at the football ground end and was going round the park. Suddenly, however, he took the key wicket as the skipper attempted to marmalise him out of Muswell Hill, and skied his drive. <br />
<br />
All of Pacific's big guns were gone, and there were fewer than 100 on the board. Could the VCC win this one? It would be a stunning result with a very much weakened team. Then came the one moment on which the match turned. There's always one, isn't there? And it's usually some sort of comic balls up on our part. So what happened this time? Well, there was one Australian slogger left. To say he was living on a prayer would be to do the lyrics of Bon Jovi a disservice. He had slapped The Example tantalisingly close to T Plimmer on a couple of occasions, and Bomb, backing the young fielder, had dispatched him to Cow Corner to field off the bowling of an increasingly pumped Stylist.&nbsp; The Stylist did what he did best: a slow ball floating in the direction of middle stump. The batsman did what he did best: a rustic mow to deep midwicket. The ball was screaming towards the smaller of the two Plimmers for what would either be the flattest of sixes or the finest of catches. Everything seemed to happen in slow motion. The Junior Doctor dived. He dived too far. The ball smashed into his head and, like a pheasant on Mav's estate, he fluttered to the floor. And proceeded to bleed a lot. And shake. it was all very scary. We were all very concerned. Especially The Stylist, who wondered what the dropping of this 'skier' would do to his figures.<br />
<br />
Slowly, young Tom was brought to his feet and lead from the field of play. Perhaps we don't need to describe what happened next for it was as inevitable as a Mav post on the Guestbook by 11am on a Monday morning. The brutal batsman cracked 79 and gave his team a decent total before the MK Don finally found the required turn to send him on his way. Bomb returned and restricted the violent Antipodean while picking up two more wickets at the other end with pacy reverse swinging yorker-cutters, but it was not enough. We had our backs to the wall.<br />
<br />
It was time for tea. And a fine tea it was too. In fact it was bloody amazing. Cakes, cream buns, coffee, tea, ciabattas, biscuits - the VCC devoured them all. Pacific, being a proper team, settled for enough carbs to take them through to the close of play. The omens weren't good.<br />
<br />
They were even worse after the second over, when duck merchant GCP was sent back to the pavillion by a cracking delivery. &quot;Too good for me,&quot; the young Scotchman's verdict. Pacific's tails were up. They had reckoned, however, without the vigilance of stocky number 3, PARP!, who hung around for what seemed like years. Clearly we were playing for a draw, even if PARP! wasn't. Or were we?&nbsp; For next man in Matt &quot;Rags to Riches&quot; started to smash their bowlers around the ground. A brief cameo from wicketkeeper Plimmer was followed by more runs from Marathon Man Lucarotti, who had finally hit form and the ball for only the second time this season. By the time their partnership was over we were, like <strike>David Kelly</strike>&nbsp; [Eds - pls insert approprate humorous simile], still not out of the woods and decidedly fucked.<br />
<br />
It was intense. The openers were back, the pitch was now well and truly obliterated, the oppo were pumped and a recovered mini Plimmer and captain Bomb were at the crease with about 8 overs to go. They gutsed it out. Weating their hearts on their sleeves and the ball on more than one occasion, they saw us to safety. To the pub for pints, recriminations and general abuse.<br />
<br />
Man Of The Match: PARP! for an innings of utmost vigilance. Completely outclassed and completely undaunted, he epitomised Village spirit.<br />
Village Idiot: Has to be the man who took one on the head, T. Plimmer. Once again failure to pay attention to Bomb's Laws of Fielding cost someone dear. When will they learn?

Actually not bad for the Rec, but it broke up towards the end
