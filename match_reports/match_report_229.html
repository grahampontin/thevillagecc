<conditions><p>&nbsp;Drunk</p> </conditions><p>As you can <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZDyWwqPcXk">see</a>&nbsp;from this video evidence, while the rest of the world acquitted themselves strongly, one country had a very bad day.</p>
<p>The VCC has a long tradition of going harder after the game than during, and this was quite the session. A cut-off time of 1am proved beyond the capability of our antipodean brethren and after being charged with the responsibility of getting both of them home, AB has begun to lobby for an earlier curfew when they're playing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's the important bit, but perhaps we should talk about the match itself as it was one of the best VCC team performances of the year. VCC were inserted (I think) on a grassy wicket that offered plenty of lateral movement to the bowlers and lots of swing in the air. Bun was first to go, trapped bang in front by the pacy, Malinga-eque Shayan, who was getting some extremely late swing. He disputed the decision. Thommo (for it was he), was having none of it. And was still having none of it eight hours later.</p>
<p>AB and Odlum fought hard to keep the new ball out, Odlum again looking promising before change bowler PVS swung one back and castled him. Sam joined the fray and looked in great form from the word go, pulling and driving straight with great power. At 20 overs VCC were looking good for a challenging 200 target - 80 up with only two men back in the hutch and some strong batting to come. Things looked a bit less clever when AB, who'd set to drop anchor for most of the innings, went to a good one that swung in and seamed away from the nagging Thompson, but Sam and Bilal picked up the pace brilliantly, Bilal whipping the ball through midwicket, and Sam cruising to one of his best 50s for the VCC, before unfortunately having to retire hurt with a hamstring strain.</p>
<p>Glen had been playing lots of T20 cricket at this very venue, and was in no mood to defend. His lower order burst, with seven fours and 3 sixes, was the defining innings of the game, turning a decent score into a very good one, possibly 50 over par. He was particularly savage on the returning Shayan, who was trying in vain to find the blockhole, ruining what had been a very good set of figures. Thommo helped him out with some lovely shots before sportingly walking after a tiny glove behind that the umpire didn't hear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the half way stage the VCC were very confident, and were all the more so after turncoat Boa nipped out dangerman Ferriera with a beauty that left him, brilliantly taken by stand-in keeper Moroney. At the other end Thommo was keeping things very tight indeed, though a recurrence of his shoulder injury was robbing him of a yard or two of pace. Stevo, making a welcome VCC return, took over from Boa, but was short of bowling and slipped in a number of full tosses, one of which ended up caught at deep midwicket. At drinks Clapham were at roughly the same stage we'd been - could they accelerate as we'd done?</p>
<p>Sadly for them, the answer was no. Bun continued to bowl brilliantly despite struggling with a knee injury, and Gupte began to turn his bad bowling form around. Needless to say, at least 3 more wickets fell to full tosses, but the bowling in between was good. In the end Clapham finished with a wicket in hand but well short, and the VCC only finished with four injured players, a good result these days: (Thompson, shoulder, McDonald, hamstring, Moroney, back and Hampton, various).</p>
<p>Village idiot(s)? Watch the video.</p>
<p>Man of the match? Moroney - match winning knock, kept well for 10 overs and bowled a tight and pacy spell.</p>
