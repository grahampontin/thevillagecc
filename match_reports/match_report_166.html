<div style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt">Conditions were good, mostly sunny with some cloud cover and a little muggy.</div> </conditions><p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt">The Village CC kicked off the 2011 campaign once again this year in Crouch End&rsquo;s postage stamp of a ground.&nbsp;This was famously the venue of last year&rsquo;s triumphant opening century by Morgs (<i>your writer &ndash; sorry I had to mention it</i>).&nbsp;The sun shined, the new kit gleamed and the Village was raring to go.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt">Ek made an inauspicious start to his time as captain losing the toss. If he carries on at this rate we will have to charter an emergency flight to Hong Kong to bring back PD Wake as official tosser.&nbsp;The Strollers choose to bat and were soon in a Kiwi spin as Boa and KP ripped through their opening batsman.&nbsp;They were 3 down before any one but Frank Extras had troubled the scorer.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt">It was time to unleash the Koeder and his inventive use of the stratosphere.&nbsp;Some rather village cricket took hold as the ball struggled to reach the other end. Just before drinks the Strollers quickened the rate with a recovery of sorts to reach 100-9;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pitcher from the other end bowling solidly.&nbsp;The last two batsmen, Connell (with mongoose in hand) and Giles produced a fine swashbuckling 10<sup>th</sup> wicket partnership to give the Strollers an outside chance at the break with 149.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt">The Village were a little shoddy in the field with 5 dropped catches.&nbsp;A notable exception was Bn, who put his arm and back on the line and showed great enthusiasm. He also wore a heated nappy.</div>
<div style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt">The Village made a messy start to the chase with Bn hitting 6 and out (<i>what odds on that outcome</i>?)&nbsp;and then Morgs comically walking across his stumps only to leave the ball and be cleaned up; his perplexing dismissal causing great hilarity amongst the Strollers.</div>
<div style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt">However, their joy was short lived as Harty set about feasting on their pies.&nbsp;He hit all sorts of majestic shots including enormous 6s over cow (including 3 in one over) and late cuts.&nbsp;He reached his ton with a stylish 6 to also finish the game, Parp! not out on 18 at the other end giving Harty some much needed mental support.</div>
<div style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt">It was an early end to the game so we set up camp in the club house and watched the other games finish.&nbsp;A great evening was had by all as <i>Parp!</i> imparted his cricketing knowledge to riveted Villagers. A fine victory left the Village looking to extend its unbeaten run to 10!&nbsp;</div>
<div style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt">MoM award &ndash; Despite great bowling from Boa it has to go to Harty for his first ever ton for the Village in rapid time. A finer innings you will not see.</div>
<div style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt">Village idiot &ndash; Morgs for his comical dismissal.</div>
<div style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt">3 points &ndash; Harty</div>
<div style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt">2 points &ndash; Boa</div>
<div style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt">1 point &ndash; Sage <i>Parp!</i></div>
