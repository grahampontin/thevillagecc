<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The build up to Wednesday&rsquo;s Twenty20 match against CMUCC saw an afternoon warm up session on the Village Guestbook with some extensive mental gymnastics led by Andy &lsquo;The Hyphenator&rsquo; Richardson. The debate largely surrounded the correct punctuation of you know who&rsquo;s / you-know-who&rsquo;s / you know whose / you-know-whose. Villagers have since forgotten who you know who actually was.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I apologise if that paragraph has left you feeling a bit nauseous but there is a cricket report to follow.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">After a miserable month of abandoned, delayed and disrupted matches at the hands of the English summer, it was with happy hearts that the Village headed off to London Fields for their game against the newly formed Cric Me Up Cricket Club. The sun was shining, the locals weren&rsquo;t shooting and even the news that pints couldn&rsquo;t be brought out from the pub didn&rsquo;t dampen the Villager&rsquo;s spirits. Page, in his wisdom, had tackled this issue by employing the &lsquo;camel tactic&rsquo; of drinking an evening&rsquo;s worth of alcohol before the game.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Village lost the toss and curiously, given the bright conditions and lack of floodlights at London Fields, were put in to bat. A wave of nervous tension swept through the Village camp as rumours quickly spread that CMUCC could be a pretty nifty bowling outfit (this may or may not have been the case as this reporter was still on the 18:14 from Liverpool St). </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">With Captain Pontin signalling his intent by leaving his helmet in the kit bag and choosing to open with Richardson as the Matt Prior to his Ali Cook (yes, it doesn&rsquo;t quite work but you get the point), the Village anticipated something big [insert Bomb wang joke here]. However, earlier fears were confirmed when the opening CMUCC bowler, Maynard, hit a decent length and took the early wicket of Richardson who, perhaps weighed down by the responsibility of opening, nicked one outside off and was caught well at slip. After 20 overs of supreme mowing by the Village, it would be fairly clear that Richardson&rsquo;s error was to attempt a proper stroke. Still, it must be noted that the first over in CMUCC history was a wicket maiden, of which they can be very proud.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Meanwhile, several members of the Village had noticed that the CMUCC cover fielder was a rather attractive blonde, wearing very tight-fitting cricket whites. Bomb declared that she was &ldquo;quite fit&rdquo;, before it was established that &lsquo;she&rsquo; was actually a &lsquo;he&rsquo;. Afterwards Bomb confirmed that he &ldquo;still would&rdquo;. This little episode raised the spirits (and, we suspect, a few other things) within a slightly inebriated and clearly euphoric, Page, who, in a scene reminiscent of someone finding a long-lost pet, cried out, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Sergio!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Back to cricket. The Village&rsquo;s batting policy of Nurdler for Nurdler and Slogger for Slogger meant that it was Deano who replaced the unfortunate Richardson, while Bomb waited in the wings for the Captain&rsquo;s wicket. Perhaps tasting a bit of his own medicine, Bomb looked on in despair as Pontin reverted to type by playing a series of very elegant, but completely un-Twenty20 forward defences. However, somewhere amidst the standard Village cries of &lsquo;IT&rsquo;S NOT A TEST MATCH!&rsquo; (before the bowler had begun his run up), &lsquo;LBW!&rsquo; (while the ball was in the air) and &lsquo;RUN THREE!&rsquo; (as the wicket-keeper gathered the ball), the captain released his inner William Wallace and you&rsquo;ll-never-take-our-freedomed his way to an aggressive 26. Obviously inspired by the attentions of Page, Sergio took a very good catch to dismiss the Captain, but this quick fire innings set the tone for the rest of the match.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">At the other end, Deano entertained the crowds with some Joga Bonita cricket. Such were the levels of the Welshman&rsquo;s confidence that this quiet man from the valleys started showboating with an extravagant array of trick shots, including the lowest hit six in Village history. Even more impressive was a strike through mid-on that initially didn&rsquo;t have the legs to get to the boundary but was suddenly given four by a local dog, which cheerily scooped up the ball in its mouth and carried it over the rope. Considering Mr Thomas&rsquo; heritage, Villagers naturally assumed that some sheepdogesque communication had taken place between man and canine.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">As Bomb strode out to replace Pontin, the usual groans could be heard within the Village camp. The WAGs decided to put the kettle on, a few Villagers went on a booze cruise to France, another saw this is an opportunity to knock War and Peace on the head and a heated debate ensued as to whether or not 15 overs provided enough time for Bomb to register a run. These doubts about Bomb&rsquo;s Twenty20 ability were clearly unfounded as the man from Portsmouth, despite being WAGless for the day, hit a series of impressive sixes, one nearly clearing the famous London Fields trees and another supremely driven back over the long-on boundary. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The retirement of Deano saw the arrival of KP, a Twenty20 player if ever there was one, who looked in good nick before skying one to mid-off for 13. Replacing KP was Littlejohns, who, after casually guiding his first ball down to leg for 4, struggled with a few good balls by the CMUCC bowlers (or alternatively, was a bit crap). Nevertheless, with Youdan coming in for the re-ally-tired Bomb at the other hand, Littlejohns and the new batsmen scampered up and down the wicket for some quick 1s and 2s. Clearly this was not what the crowd wanted and soon the batsmen heard cries of &ldquo;your strike rate&rsquo;s only 90&rdquo; and, after the middle finger was waved at the baying masses, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s given himself out!&rdquo; As the CMUCC captain brought himself back on to bowl, some sort of statement was required. With Bomb&rsquo;s advice of getting down the wicket still fresh in his mind Littlejohns prepared himself to attack. With the reverse sweep. Unfortunately, so premeditated was the shot that he was halfway through it before realising that a head-high beamer had been bowled. The slightly sickening realisation that a reverse sweep was perhaps not the best method of dealing with such a ball meant that a rapid adjustment to the reverse hook was required. Miraculously, contact was made and facial surgery averted for the time being. Undeterred, Littlejohns followed this up with two more reverses, one of which cleared the boundary for six, before he also retired for 30.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">As if the crowd had not had enough excitement for one day, the prospect of civil war suddenly reared its ugly head with Hayles joining his housemate Youdan in the middle. At first the Village relaxed in their deckchairs, confidently assuming that the bond between the two batsmen would see them both comfortably making their 30s. A few Villagers suggested that the run calling seemed a little unconventional, but these dissenters were quickly hushed by the majority, who argued that it must be some kind of telepathic communication. How wrong they were. When a standard single was taken and the fielder gathered the ball, Hayles suddenly called for another run. Madness ensued (which means I can&rsquo;t quite remember what happened) and before you could say Inzamam-Ul-Haq, a rather miffed Youdan was carrying his bat to the boundary. A month of washing up for Hayles then. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The rollercoaster of an evening continued as Dave Ireland walked out swinging his bat with obvious intent. Although it turned out to be a reasonably restrained innings, Ireland highlighted the importance of &lsquo;flashing hard&rsquo; (unfortunately Page would take this too literally later in the day) on this wicket, with one outside edge flying over the slips for four. Richardson noted that he probably would have had the same result if he&rsquo;d flashed instead of prodded earlier in the innings. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">With Hayles well on his way to the thirty mark, Woodhouse, promoted from number 11 for the day, began to hop about at the prospect of registering his first runs of the season. Eventually the retirement came and Woodhouse was given his moment to shine. Once again the sense of occasion may have got to Woodhouse and no runs came off the bat, but a nifty leg bye was taken and the fact that the bails remained on top of the stumps was considered a resounding success by all.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In summary, this was a truly swashbuckling effort by the Village, who were in no mood to show any mercy to the newcomers and posted a very intimidating 216 for 4.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">After a swift turn around, the Village opened the bowling with the Hoggard-and-Harmisonesque (the Hyphenator will crucify me for that one) combination of Woodhouse and Ireland. Woodhouse kept it very tight with 2 overs going for only ten runs, while Ireland struck the fear of god in to the batsmen and happily removed the No 2&rsquo;s leg stump. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Coming on for Woodhouse was Deano with his reverse-cartwheel-like action, which threatened to take wickets but was ultimately undermined by having the short boundary on the leg side. Taking over from Ireland was Richardson, whose 4 overs of well-pitched, accurate bowling threatened to tear through the opposition&rsquo;s middle order. CMUCC rode their luck for a while but Richardson was eventually rewarded with an edge sharply taken at slip by Pontin, who had handed the wicket-keeping duties to Hayles. Inspired by this and a very timid looking No 4, Richardson decided to send down a fast ball which went through the batsmen&rsquo;s bat (literally) and on to the middle stump.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Page&rsquo;s spell was a game of two halves with an expensive opening over followed by a scintillating second, which almost took the fight away from the opposition. Bomb, however, had other ideas. Whether it was out of respect for his own body or a lack of respect for the opposition, Bomb decided to bowl spin. After being slapped for 2 consecutive sixes, he decided to step up the pace a bit and bowled&hellip;6 wides. A full toss LBW decision made up for this to a certain extent but Pontin decided to pull off the big man (yawn, Sergio joke etc) before he could challenge the opposition captain&rsquo;s bowling figures of 64 off four overs. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">At this point it should be noted that a local Hackney resident had provided your match reporter with a running commentary of the entire innings. Despite being reasonably loopy, the man was pretty spot-on with his analysis, describing Richardson as &ldquo;a proper bowler with a quality action&rdquo;, Page as &ldquo;slightly twisted and needs to be a bit straighter&rdquo; and Bomb as &ldquo;a bit slow without much turn, but ok considering he&rsquo;s not a bowler&rdquo;.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">KP replaced Richardson and produced a typically tight spell of two overs for 9 runs. After calling for &ldquo;someone to take a bloody catch off my bowling&rdquo; it was perhaps inevitable that the best chance would fall to the New Zealander himself. Technically the ball fell closer to Page but he absolved himself of any blame by claiming &ldquo;I was distracted by KP pounding away behind me!&rdquo;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">And then the captain bowled. Never has the Village self-sledging machine worked so effectively. &ldquo;Six sixes!&rdquo; KP shouted, &ldquo;a pint if you knock it back over his head&rdquo; promised Richardson, causing a slightly bemused but very wound up No 6 batsmen to take took the biggest mow of the day and have his shit ruined first ball. This was no flash in the pan as the No. 8 also fell to Pontin through a well-taken catch by Mav at mid-off. Littlejohns tried to keep things tight at the other end with a very close stumping effort by Youdan. However, this day belonged to the captain, whose bowling figures of 2-0-9-2 and 26 runs off the bat established his status as the Darren Maddy of North East London Twenty20 cricket (cheque or bank transfer please, Graham).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp; </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">CMUCC&rsquo;s 157 for 6 was 60 runs short of the required target but they should be congratulated for putting in a strong first performance. A number of their bowlers hit good lengths and with a few more balls on the stumps in future, they should be a tricky side to handle. Other areas which may need some attention were their insistence on changing wicket-keeper at the end of each over and the &lsquo;cumulative&rsquo; recording of bowling figures in the scorebook &ndash; KP&rsquo;s two overs appeared to have gone for 120 runs. Nevertheless, the game was played in a fantastic spirit and the Village look forward to future fixtures with the Cric Me Ups.</font></p>

Villagers suspected that Page was simply preparing himself for the long-awaited return of Molly Organs, who will be gracing the batting heaven that is Springfield Park this Saturday.</span>
