<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">You won't find team building exercises like this in any management manual. The Village headed to Cambridge for the second time this season on a two-day tour aimed at building morale ahead of the critical league game against London Fields, but what they got was more akin to a civil war.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Optimistically dubbed &quot;The Tour Where We Play Some Cricket&quot; - following the washout two weeks previously - there were frantic meteorological consultations taking place in the days before the tour began due to a forecast of heavy rain. Thankfully this proved to be nothing more than an elaborate Met Office hoax, but another obstacle to actually playing some cricket presented itself when the appointed opposition - the venerable Queen's College Cambridge - phoned 15 minutes before the toss to inform tour manager AA Page that they would not, in fact, be turning up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">This came as a huge disappointment to the small number of Villagers who, upon arriving at the magnificent Barton Road ground, opted to warm up with a nets session. As they returned to the pavilion more pumped than Arnold Schwarzenegger in his heyday, the bad news was conveyed and a decision had to be made - pack up and go to the pub, or turn on each other for a game of six-a-side. Owing in no small part to the surroundings and the weather, the latter was chosen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">So The Village's bonding weekend turned into internecine rivalry. Those members of the team clever enough to have attended Queen's formed one team (The Queens, led by AA Page) while those members new enough to the Village formed another (The Village People, led A Bomb). Two innings, 12 overs, everyone bowls two overs, batsmen must retire once they reach 30, batting order reversed for the second innings. Game on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The Queens batted first, and despite the fact that The Village People were a man short (awaiting the arrival of Maj), opening pair Page and Stevo strode to the crease to be greeted with the quite unbelievable sight of&nbsp;two slips and a gully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">A typically hostile over from KP Bowman followed, which made Bomb's field placings look inspired, and Page was out stumped thanks to quick work from Marrow. But things began to unravel when Woodhouse took up the attack from the other end - new batsman Catso pulling everything from outside off stump through the vacant leg side.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">With The Village People beginning to toil, Maj was handed the ball and promptly removed Stevo for 17, tempting him into a thick edge which was well taken behind. That was as good as it got, as Catso made his way to a serene 30 while Richardson - wielding his new bat - did likewise. McInnes and Rahilly continued the assault, leading Queens to a first innings total of 109.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">In reply, Bomb revealed more of his tactical thinking by sending in KP Bowman and Deano, who set about The Queens' bowling with some gusto. The New Zealander powered his way to 30 and retired, bringing bunny Woodhouse to the crease for a golden duck, before Maj and Deano carried on the run fest. The Welshman was eventually out for 26, caught at midwicket off Richardson, while Maj and Marrow carried their side to an identical 109. Laconic gentleman genius that he is, Bomb didn't have to get out of his seat to bat and was able to keep Fran Bell - the only WAG to make the journey - company. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">More tactics followed from the West Country's finest. Rather than attempt to take wickets, he instructed his side to try and bowl economically to openers Brown and Rahilly. Sadly this plan was ruined as Brown helped himself to Woodhouse's bowling, before Marrow produced a beauty which bowled Rahilly round his legs. This brought McInnes to the crease, and both he and Brown made their way to 30 as the revered bowling attack of KP, Deano and Bomb failed to fire.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Brown's milestone brought Richardson to the crease, and controversy was to court the big man. Mixing fluid strokeplay with some scratchy stuff he (inexplicably) cabbaged his knee trying not to be run out, and called for a runner. The recently retired (and far more athletic) McInnes returned to fulfil the role, turning one into twos, and twos into threes. Worse was to come for The Village People when, after a particularly strong over from Bomb that had Richardson guessing at every delivery, the batsman popped up a dolly to the hapless Woodhouse who put the chance down. B</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">y the time he was run out in the last over, most of the damage had been done. Page was also run out trying to add to the total, which ended at 114.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Bomb and Marrow began the chase well, but Richardson got the better of the captain to put himself firmly ahead in their personal battle. Maj fared little better, being caught off Page for 9, leaving Marrow and Woodhouse to put on a stand of 23 which featured precisely no runs from the latter batsman. KP and Marrow took up the challenge, and were just about up with the run rate, but once Marrow retired on 30 things began to look bleak. KP made 19 before being run out by miles, bringing Marrow back to the crease. He and Deano continued to pile on the runs in difficult circumstances, but once Marrow was out (again), Deano had no option but to go for big runs. It didn't work, his shit was ruined by the excellent Stevo, and that was that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">There was some ill feeling among members of The Village People because of Richardson's runner, and because The Queens had an extra fielder, so it was left to the BBQ to try and restore some team spirit. Thankfully, The Village CC's Antipodean import got on the case, and the day's hostilities were forgotten in a haze of beer and perfectly cooked fodder.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Man Of The Match is a tough one. Richardson deserved it for his batting, but in a game against your own clubmates you really shouldn't injure yourself. So Stevo gets it, for knocks of 17 and 0 not out, and bowling figures of 1-14 and 3-7. The Village Idiot jersey went to Woodhouse. Two ducks, no wickets for lots, and a dropped catch. Idiot.</span></p>
