<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">The all-left-handed opening combination of James de Mellow and Sam McDonald got The Village off to a solid start, sensibly rotating the strike and putting away the loose balls. Then disaster struck the luckless McDonald &mdash; no, not a jaffa of a ball, screamer of a catch, or a pitch-induced cobra &mdash; but an umpiring decision by his own teammate Alex &ldquo;Parp&rdquo; Hanson. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">It happened like this. McDonald attempted to glance a just short of a good length ball, pitching well outside leg, down to fine leg for a single &mdash; and missed. The ball flicked his trousers (or &ldquo;pants&rdquo; to us Antipodeans) on the way through to the keeper. The opposition launched an ambitious, but well-orchestrated appeal. On the sidelines, the Villagers chuckled at their cheek, as even from our vantage point at extra-long-off, we could see the distance between McDonald&rsquo;s bat and the ball. However, to our surprise, Parp, standing at the bowler&rsquo;s end, then briefly extended the index finger of a hand positioned at belly-height, in horizontal fashion &mdash; a sui generis umpiring signal which this match reporter has been unable to locate in the </span><a href="http://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-3-the-umpires/"><span lang="EN-AU">Laws of Cricket</span></a><span lang="EN-AU">. He then strolled towards his umpiring colleague Chris Pitcher at square leg. When this match reporter later asked Parp about his reason for doing so, he explained that he wanted to check with Pitcher that McDonald had indeed hit the ball. How Pitcher could have ascertained this from this vantage point at square leg is perhaps a question best left to the Oracle at Delphi. And so it was that Pitcher&rsquo;s reasonable reply to Parp&rsquo;s question was that he couldn&rsquo;t tell whether McDonald had nicked it from his position at square leg. Undeterred by this non-affirmative answer to his question, Parp proceeded to unfurl a horizontal index finger for a second time. McDonald rather generously interpreted Parp&rsquo;s semaphoric action as a signal that he was out and walked. When asked by this match reporter standing on the sidelines whether he&rsquo;d hit it, McDonald&rsquo;s answer, drawing on all his reserves of Old Harrovian restraint, was a measured &ldquo;no&rdquo;.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Shortly thereafter, De Mellow unluckily got out &mdash; this match reporter can&rsquo;t remember how &mdash; after doing the hard work getting in. That left The Village in the good, but not impregnable, position of 2/85 off 22 overs in a 40 over game, with Nick Troja joining Adam Simson at the crease. The match was won by their superlative batting in the last 18 overs. Troj signalled his intent from the outset by getting off the mark with a six, straight driven into the wind with a long-on perched on the boundary. Their unbeaten, ball-crushing partnership took The Village to 2/250 from their 40 overs and the game was as good as over. Troj got his ton, but Simson unluckily finished 14 short. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">The Village&rsquo;s diligent scorer for this game, Lukas Becker, kept track of the batsmen&rsquo;s strike rates in the handwritten scorebook, but this match reporter only had access to the online scorebook (which doesn&rsquo;t show strike rates) in writing this match report. Suffice to say that, if memory serves, Troj was striking at close to 200 and Simson must have been striking well in excess of 100.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">A good all-round bowling and fielding performance saw The Village win comfortably as the opposition finished on 9/199. Special mention must go to Ben Hampton and EK who deservedly took three and two wickets apiece by keeping it full and straight.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU" style="font-size:11.0pt;line-height:

mso-ansi-language:EN-AU;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">The result may well have been a full-blown rout but for a missed stumping chance. Having reduced the opposition to 4 for two digits, EK introduced spin into the attack in the form of Troj&rsquo;s combo leggies and offies. Early in his spell, Troj comprehensively beat their number six, then new to the crease, as he danced down the pitch to a well-flighted leggie. De Mellow who, in his defence was keeping for the first time in years, did a passable Matthew Wade impersonation, failing to take the ball to complete a straightforward stumping. Emboldened by his early reprieve, their number six started to use his feet well to successfully disrupt Troj&rsquo;s length and batted well to finish unbeaten on 91 &mdash; their only batsman to pass 22 &mdash; to take his team to a respectable total.</span></p>
