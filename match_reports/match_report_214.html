<p class="MsoNormal">After losing the toss VCC were in the field with Lukas and Ben given the new ball.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Ruislip boys were aggressive from the start and got away with the odd lusty blow but by the end of the 7<sup>th</sup> over no less than 5 of the Ruislip boys were back in the hutch with a mere 30 or so runs on the board. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Amazingly 3 of the dismissals came from catches in the slip cordon. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The first off Ben was a low fast catch that Harty couldn&rsquo;t bend down to, but luckily hit him on the foot and ballooned safely into the gloves of keeper Glen. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Troja and Harty later pouched one each at first and second slip respectively, off the bowling of Lukas.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It was looking as though we might have been heading for an early finish and the foot was taken off the gas, so to speak, much to the dismay of the fiery Kiwi who had already claimed 3 and appeared to be on track for a nice 5-fer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pitcher, Eddy, EK and Naz all had a go and all took some stick, however Pitcher did manage to have Hardik caught behind.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Thereafter the Ruislip boys took the long handle to us and they raced their way past 100, then 150.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At this point most of us were thinking, great at least we now have a target to chase, and when the 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> wickets fell the end seemed nigh. But batter 9 (who made 54), batter 10 (who made 60no) and batter 11 (who made 24) had other ideas.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These guys literally smashed 110 off the last 10 overs of the innings, including massive sixes off all of the VCC&rsquo;s leading bowlers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Incredible stuff and a slightly bewildered VCC were set 262 to win off their 40 overs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Morgs and JDM opened up and JDM was bowled in the 3<sup>rd</sup> over. Harty came and went in the same over, gone to an LBW. This brought the ever reliable Troja to the wicket and he went about steadying the ship, and seemed to relish the change of bowling that brought Hardik into the fray.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Morgs appeared quite comfortable with Hardik in the attack, but unfortunately didn&rsquo;t last long, providing the simplest of catches to short cover from a leading edge.&nbsp; Glen replaced Morgs and the run rate immediately lifted as he delighted the crowd of 4 with some clean hitting to all parts of the boundary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Glen brought up his 2<sup>nd</sup> half century for the VCC, but was dismissed almost immediately after a penetrating Hardik delivery that took his middle stump.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Lukas joined Troja and started watchfully as Troja accelerated to yet another half century, but was given out LBW almost immediately taking a cross-batted swipe at a straight one. Ben replaced Troja and after a few solid defensive shots started to send a few home, and while Lukas and he were there, we felt we still had a chance. But alas both fell victim to the dangerous Gopal, and the innings soon came to a conclusion with Chris Pitcher left stranded on 7.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">MoM goes to Lukas for 3 wickets and 30 runs. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes"><br />
