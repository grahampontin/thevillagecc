<p class="MsoNormal">This was my 4<sup>th</sup> experience of playing London Fields for the Village, we never seem to play to our potential against these blokes and I was interested to see how we would conspire to under-perform this year.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After electing to bat Captain Gupte asked Lukas and Ollie to start us off. Both were looking comfortable at the crease and Lukas, who had executed a couple of Gower-like cover drives, looked set for a big one. Then in the 5<sup>th</sup> over disaster struck, Lukas played all around a Sanders straight ball and was bowled on 12. Then double disaster, the great Troja trapped LBW first ball (who would have thought), plumb as plumb and looked as if he would have walked if umpire Pitch hadn&rsquo;t sent him on his way.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then you guessed it, triple disaster, Bilal completes the hat trick by missing one down leg side, lifted his back foot, and keeper Robin Friend had the bails off in a flash.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Morgs and Harty set about steadying the ship, but it didn&rsquo;t last long as Morgs was caught in the gully playing a flashy drive, Naz came and went without adding to the score and Harty was out caught off a leading edge from an innocuous leg side delivery.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At 6-40, the Village looked down and out, but our mighty Captain and debutant Ramesh, for whom the Village effect has not yet set in, had other ideas.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ramesh turned the game immediately, lofting 2 straight drives for 4 in his first over, and treating the despondent Village top order to a master class of calypso stroke play.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the other end EK was playing the sheet anchor role, and together a partnership of 60 was produced.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ramesh finally succumbed for 35, and great debut with the bat, and all eyes turned to Ben Hampton. It has been noted from time to time that Ben may not have the best temperament for a batsman, the fiery Kiwi preferring to deal in DLF maximum&rsquo;s, yet on Saturday we saw the Ben of old, the elegant forward defense, plenty of work in the V, and the nonchalant dispatch of the occasional full toss. Ben made a very useful 20 before trying one shot too many.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And from there we didn&rsquo;t last long, all out 199, with EK carrying his bat for a well compiled 37 not out.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In reply the Village tried to take advantage of the 2 paced pitch, opening with KP and EK.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Robin Friend immediately showed his class with the bat, playing a magnificent off drive for 4 on just his 3<sup>rd</sup> ball, and promptly dispatching the next delivery from KP over square leg boundary for 6.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And that was pretty much theme of play for the next hour or so. Though the Village tried hard, Friend dispatched the ball to all parts. We were unlucky to have a couple of close LBW shouts turned down, and a couple of tough catches grassed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Finally we broke through, with Ben bowling Pereira on 13. No 3 had some luck and put on 38 before Troja bowled him a full toss and he hit it straight to Lukas at mid wicket. But the Friend show continued and he finally reached his ton and retired himself. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>At that point Fields still needed about 40 runs, debutant Ramesh was given the ball and clean up Jason Lord, and followed that with a 2<sup>nd</sup> wicket 2 balls later, thus claiming 2 wickets in his first over for the Village (a record?)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ramesh finished with the fine figures of 2.2 overs 3 wickets for 5 runs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However it was too little too late, and Fields reached the target with 8 overs and 4 wickets in hand.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">MoM: Ramesh for an entertaining 35 and 3 wickets.</p>
