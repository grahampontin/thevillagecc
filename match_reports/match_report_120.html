<conditions><p>Too long ago, can't quite remember, but the sun was going down rapidly.&nbsp; Ah that happens every night you say, oh well. You get my point.&nbsp;</p> </conditions><p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt">The National Audit Office (NAO) lived up to their bean counting stereotype when they decided they did not want any dinner post game as it did not pass their rigorous cost/benefit analysis.&nbsp;A Village CC tea was not &lsquo;value for money&rsquo;.&nbsp;Consequently, the Villagers were left hungry after the game.&nbsp;This motivated the Village to punish these agents of hunger.&nbsp;Grrr...</div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt">The NAO soon felt the wrath of the Village with some swash buckling antics from marathon man including a dispatched 6 over long on.&nbsp;That brought out their finest bowler Poggose who came on and proceeded to clean up both MMJL and Molly Organs (with a snorter of an away swinger early doors pitching middle hitting off).&nbsp;Once KP came and went that brought in Harty who looked a class apart.&nbsp;He and Ed Hayles shone with some fine hitting.&nbsp;Though they were fortunate to now be facing steak and kidney from both ends. Nevertheless, they slapped said culinary feasts to all corners.&nbsp;Both Hales and Harty then had to retire on 30 only to be back before the end as wickets regularly fell once they departed.&nbsp;Kiwi Ben was run out after some good work in the field, Dave Ireland, Martin and Eddie came and went in a flash and Bomb went after looking good he mistimed a ball, spooned it in the air caught well and was well caught by the oppo.&nbsp;With the return of Hales and Harty once the rest had come and gone a final over was slapped for 24 included two huge 6s for Harty taking him to a fine and authoritative 50 off the final ball bringing our total to a round 200.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt">As the light faded the Village took to the field confident in an easy victory.&nbsp;It turned out to be a strange day in the field for Eddie who conspired to get 4 wickets &ndash; run out, caught, bowled and stumped only for all 4 to be turned down controversially!&nbsp;The first of these being a catch off Bomb&rsquo;s first over, the opener slapping it to cow. Eddie running back took a fine catch only to fall over an imaginary rope.&nbsp;Bomb soon got his man from a similar shot well caught by Kiwi Ben at long off.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt">The risen Christ next non-wicket came from throwing down the stumps from 30 yards only to be turned down by a lazy and poorly placed umpire, the batsman a good meter out. Outrageous decision really. His third and fourth non-wickets followed with a stumping turned down with the batsman&rsquo;s leg still dangling in the air (more poor adjudication by the bean counters) and then Morgans conspired to appeal for a stumping when the ball hit the top of off stump!&nbsp;With every one looking around bemused it was decided that his hands may have gone ahead of the stumps! (Sorry Eddie) Farcical really.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt">As the light descended and the oppo were never up with the 10 an over required rate the Village turned to spin to even things up.&nbsp;Marathon-man came on and bowled a consistent line just wide of the cut strip.&nbsp;With the Umpire complaining of tiredness in his shoulders, so frequent were the wide calls, MMJL was soon taken off to a rousing cheer.&nbsp;Never has one man conceded so many wides in one over.&nbsp;The Village entertained themselves in the field however with strong chat ruining the confidence most bowlers who came on.&nbsp;In particular, Dave Ireland&rsquo;s bowling disappointed, spanked to all corners, out-chatted it must be said by his own captain.&nbsp;Ben&rsquo;s bowling also suffered taking a bit of a beating, but despite this the NAO were never in with a shout.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt">WIth the oppo&rsquo; well short of the total and another wicket falling in the fading light to KP&rsquo;s spin, (stumped Morgans), the Umpire had a whack last ball. Relieved Village fielders were glad no ball headed their way head height in the descending gloom.&nbsp;The eventual winning victory was 50 runs, with 3 wickets for KP, one Bomb and a lot of wides for MMJL.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt">The magic&nbsp;moment if the game came from our esteemed leader, Captain KP, who&nbsp;made up for some previous sloppy fielding and catching with an outrageous run out going the wrong way, throwing the ball backwards to remove the batsman running to the non-strikers end unaware of the danger of the predatory Kiwi!&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt">With victory secured, we headed back in the direction of the pavilion in merry spirits, its lights now the only indication of any building near by.&nbsp;We looked forward to eating and drinking the night away only to remember the lack of food, sacrificed in the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;efficiency savings&rsquo;... Cue kebab shops London wide sharpening their cutting knives.</div>
