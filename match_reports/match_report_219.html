<conditions><p class="MsoNormal">Pleasant, mild and sunny, with no wind to speak of.<o:p></o:p></p> </conditions><p>There&rsquo;s a place in the sun and today it&rsquo;s South Wimbledon.&nbsp; Haydons Road Recreation Ground the venue for this eagerly anticipated re-match with our friends in pink from the Southwark and Lambeth Cricket Club. &nbsp;Earlier in the season we saw all manner of tension and drama in Wimbledon proper, with Southwark and Lambeth emerging victorious in the penultimate over of the days play.&nbsp; The ground in Wimbledon itself was strikingly similar to that of today, a fairly even covering of grass across a field which was a devoid of contours.&nbsp; In the centre of the field the grass was cut a little shorter, somewhat like a crop circle, except it was an almost perfect rectangular arrangement.&nbsp; Its beauty and simplicity almost took your breath away, it really was quite something to behold.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Southwark and Lambeth CC seemed worryingly pumped for this encounter, they appeared to have done some research on the mighty Village and were running themselves through a serious set of fielding drills before play commenced.&nbsp; The Village looked all at sea in comparison, players running late, others with the runs before a ball had even been bowled.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t bode particularly well, but, hopes were still fairly high that once play started everything would be fine.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Alan White, coming off a scintillating ton in Rode (Somerset) strode purposefully out to the middle with Sam McDonald, both left-handers appearing to be quite confident.&nbsp; Alan&rsquo;s form may have been left behind in the West Country though (along with several of the twilight years of this reporters life), as he succumbed for only four to an in swinging delivery.&nbsp; Alan&rsquo;s resplendent new gear remaining in pristine condition was small consolation for this icon of the game.&nbsp; At first drop Nick Troja was trialing some new gear of his own, opting for a v-neck t-shirt, instead of the more regulation cricketing shirt.&nbsp; The fashion conscious Australian might not have impressed the purists, but, who knows, perhaps next year&rsquo;s range might see a move in this direction (a recent poll strongly suggests otherwise).&nbsp; Troja and McDonald, McDonald and Troja played sensibly against some good bowling from the openers, who were extracting movement in the air and off the pitch.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Shepard appeared as first change, he calmed his flock immediately, sending McDonald and Troja back to the pen in quick time.&nbsp; The Villages dogs were barking when Marcus Littlejohns followed Duncan Fudge sheepishly off to the back paddock.&nbsp; Ollie Morgans and Dan Plimmer made it through to drinks with just 80 up on the board.&nbsp; It was barmy day at Haydons Road and with sunbathers surrounding the outfield, it wasn&rsquo;t all bad.&nbsp; The Village knew they needed to urgently fix their game against a determined opposition who could sense victory after snaffling five of the top six batsmen with none passing twenty.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Morgans and Plimmer resumed proceedings and it was as you were, with disciplined bowling keeping the batsman tied down.&nbsp; Plimmer blinked first though, out caught.&nbsp; The Village were six down and it&rsquo;s fair to say the omens from earlier were looking on the money.&nbsp; Ben Hampton joined Morgans and they tried to lift the tempo.&nbsp; Morgans increasing his score exponentially with three boundary fours in one over.&nbsp; He was to be undone shortly after, dancing down the pitch and tickling the ball through to the keeper.&nbsp; This brought the male model from Mumbai, Eklavya Gupte to the crease.&nbsp; The Captain looked in fine touch immediately, executing textbook cover drives and the odd straight one.&nbsp; Almost as if he was setting an example for his teammates.&nbsp; Hampton helped Shepard to a well deserved five wicket bag, failing to connect with a straight one.&nbsp; Paul Bowman added some valuable runs with Gupte, falling in the final over trying to post a total for his team.&nbsp; Gupte, who played the best innings of the day for the Village fell off the very last ball of the innings.&nbsp; With Chris Pitcher not out, the score was 180, good if you&rsquo;re Phil Taylor, not so good if you are playing cricket though, extras top scoring with 33.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Several Villagers opted for fish and chips at lunch, perhaps not the diet of elite high performance athletes.&nbsp; The Village opted against a set of fielding drills, in what was either a display of over confidence or because they were weighed down by the lunch.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Welcome back here to the Haydons Rd. R.G. for commencement of the second innings.&nbsp; The Village team defending a total which looked around 40-50 runs shy of par on a decent wicket with a quick outfield.&nbsp; Bowman took his mark then made his way to the crease, first the left foot, then the right foot, then the left again in pretty quick succession.&nbsp; He gathered pace as he approached the wicket, really reaching for the heavens with that front arm before releasing the ball. At the other end Hampton was mixing up some good with some not so good.&nbsp; The Southwark and Lambeth opening batsmen started cautiously, picking off the odd stray delivery and missing a few good ones in equal measure.&nbsp; Then the drops started, a caught and bowled chance shelled, a drop a mid wicket, there were to be that many more drops, it&rsquo;s probably not unfair to compare the days fielding display to Chinese water torture.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Alan &lsquo;White Lighting&rsquo; White came on at first change and collected a wicket in his first over, with McDonald completing the only successful catch (or perhaps reverse drop is more appropriate for the this day).&nbsp; White Lighting didn&rsquo;t strike twice though as he shelled one off his own bowling shortly afterwards.&nbsp; With the game just starting to get beyond the Village at the drinks break, the Captain brought himself on to see if there was any turn out there in the middle.&nbsp; Gupte bowled a tight line and length, but, it wasn&rsquo;t exactly turning square.&nbsp; With the batsman not needing to take any risks at this juncture, it was going to take divine intervention for the Village to win this encounter.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Pitcher joined the fray with an accurate spell.&nbsp; T-shirt wearing Troja wasn&rsquo;t quite up to his usual high standards, possibly unrelated to his attire, but, who knows in these crazy times we live in.&nbsp; Troja did manage to get one to grip though as he castled the number three collecting the second wicket of the innings.&nbsp; That was to be that though, as Southwark and Lambeth cruised to an empathic victory.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Village left to rue way too many drops, some harder than others, but, with a below par total they all needed to be taken.&nbsp; The batting was also disappointing with the top order failing to capitalise after several starts.&nbsp; Full credit to the opposition though, they all played well and thoroughly deserved their victory.&nbsp; We look forward to a rematch in 2013, when hopefully the Village can at learn to catch.&nbsp; So it&rsquo;s goodbye for now from sunny South Wimbledon, where there&rsquo;s hope for everyone.<o:p></o:p></p>
