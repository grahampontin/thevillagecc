<p>&nbsp;</p> </conditions><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman">Village travelled right down into the fetid bowel of south London, Surbiton, to take on the Gents of London in a 35 over match on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman; min-height: 15.0px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman">Village was looking to extend its winning streak to two by fielding, on paper at least, one of its strongest sides of the year.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman; min-height: 15.0px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman">We batted first on a minefield of a pitch and through steady showers. Gupte made a rare appearance at the top of the order with Simson, and made a watchful start. Simson went for 8, bringing Harty to the crease.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman; min-height: 15.0px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman">VCC&rsquo;s fearless leaders worked the ball around steadily in the tough conditions, Gupte especially showing off some sublime off-side shots.&nbsp;Gupte eventually had his stumps rattled for 18, bringing in &ldquo;VCC&rsquo;s greatest ever batsman&rdquo; Nick Troja to the crease.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman; min-height: 15.0px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman">The Victorian duo kept up the watchful tone on a pitch that was getting steadily worse. Troja got hit in the shoulder and chin by innocuous-looking deliveries just short of a length, and both batsmen did well to defend half-track deliveries that shot through at ankle height.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman; min-height: 15.0px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman">After 20 overs the VCC scoreboard showed a mere 64 runs.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman; min-height: 15.0px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman">The fireworks started soon after, with Harty and Troja going after the bowling at great pace. Full tosses were carted over cow corner repeatedly by Harty, with the Ballarat boy taking 25 off an over (444661) which contained five full tosses.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman; min-height: 15.0px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman">Troja was no slouch either, swatting two big sixes and putting on a master class of late cutting.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman; min-height: 15.0px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman">Harty was eventually bowled for 73 attempting to launch one bowler into Sussex. This brought Matt Boa&rsquo;s mate Lucky to the crease, who worked the ball around for some quick singles. This annoyed Troja, who eschews crafty ones and twos for brutishly clubbing boundaries. (in fact, in his eventual score of 82*, all but 14 runs were from fours and sixes).</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman; min-height: 15.0px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman">Lucky wore a ball to the throat but was eventually caught and bowled for 11, bringing KP to the crease for a final flourish. Troja selfishly scored 20 off the final over to earn the new name of &ldquo;red ink&rdquo;, bringing his average up to a ludicrous 244. VCC members await the onset of the Village effect to bring this overachiever back to Earth.</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman">So after 35 overs, Village put on 210 for the loss of four wickets. To save you reaching for the calculator, that&rsquo;s 9.73 runs per over for the last 15. Impressive stuff.</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman">After a lunch of Sainsbury&rsquo;s basic sandwiches Village took the field in driving rain. The Lords test match had been sensibly called off hours before but for reasons of stubbornness we carried on regardless.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman; min-height: 15.0px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman">Boa and Becker opened the bowling, with Boa in particular looking good in slippery conditions. Boa picked up the first wicket through a particularly fortunate stroke of luck, with the ball dropping at the batsman&rsquo;s feet and rolling down the 45 degree slope to take off the bails.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman; min-height: 15.0px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman">Boa followed up a few overs later to clip a glove on the way through to Simson, who took a good catch. But meanwhile the batsmen were going at a good six an over so it was time for a change.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman; min-height: 15.0px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman">Pitcher and Bun came on second change, and C-Pitch was instantly successful. In an inspired piece of captaincy, EK brought himself into a short mid-wicket position and took a great catch to dismiss a fairly handy looking batsman. Observers were pleased at EK&rsquo;s new catching form, but left scratching their heads in an attempt to remember the last time EK had actually held on to a chance.&nbsp;Troja meanwhile attempted a huge dive at mid off for a chance off C-Pitch but only got his fingertips to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman; min-height: 15.0px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman">Bun as usual bowled well without luck but with heavy cursing.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman; min-height: 15.0px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman">The rain got heavier and the ball was starting to get saturated, so the teams finally walked off the field with the Gents&rsquo; score at 120/3 off 17 overs. All in attendance were disappointed that a match that could have gone to the wire had to be abandoned, but that rain had well and truly set in.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman; min-height: 15.0px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times New Roman">In a fitting end to a dismal day, both teams retired to a Weatherspoons on a roundabout and ate cheesy chips.</p>
