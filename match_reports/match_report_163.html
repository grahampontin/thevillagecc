<conditions><p>Variable: when Bomb was batting, it looked like Sabina Park in 1998. When he wasn't it looked like Antigua in 1994.</p> </conditions><p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-indent: 36pt">Some Villagers were in a better state than others for Sunday&rsquo;s fixture. Your correspondent was unable to take part &ndash; due to injury rather than hangover &ndash; but despite the rumours of a strong opposition, the VCC turned up to Keevil keen for a second round of cricketing excellence. Points needed to be proved. Steve Harty wore a look of grim determination. Alan White&rsquo;s grim determination was simply not to soil his whites.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 36pt">The Village lost the toss and were sent into the field. The bowling was economical and occasionally threatening, but beating the bat early on didn&rsquo;t turn into early wickets. The Keevil openers ground out thirty or so off the first ten overs, with one &ndash; Rob Robinson &ndash; looking in ominously good touch. KP and Giles &ndash; still chipper about his three wicket over including one raised Fielden Finger of Doom to Me Harty &ndash; went wicketless. KP suffered the further ignominy of being referred to as any bald person the fielders could think of, examples of this shining wit including Gail Porter, although Jade Goody may have been left alone on taste grounds.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 36pt">On came Lucas Becker, replacing a KP who has had better days at Keevil. Lucas was another who had enjoyed himself the previous evening, but whatever the preparation, he removed the number two and three with an excellent spell of controlled medium pace bowling. The number three, incidentally, was genuinely called Tom Collins.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 36pt">At the other end, Craig Woodhouse bowled with control and was genuinely threatening. Having taken a sharp return chance the day before, his tail was up and he accounted for the beefy number four, but not before a misunderstanding between Giles and Steve had robbed him of a precious wicket. Throughout this, the Keevil number one had been quietly accumulating runs, and had by this point passed fifty.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 36pt">Chris Pitcher&rsquo;s bowling had a similar swinging, dipping quality to Craig&rsquo;s, and with the danger at Keevil of being sent for a long run into the fields it was brave of both of them to pitch the ball right up to the batsman. Chris went for one big six, a sort of slog/drive over wide mid-on, but the batsman &ndash; the dangerous looking Forsey &ndash; went playing a similar stroke, pouched (quite literally; the catching technique was extraordinary) by the Bomb at deep midwicket. Chris also accounted for the youngster Hamblin, sharply stumped by Morgans, who kept wicket convincingly throughout.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 36pt">With the innings drawing to a close, Bowman elected to let others take the stick, rather than complete his allocation. Eklavya bowled a brilliant length and showed a great change of pace, and Steve Harty at the other end ripped down some dangerous-looking medium. Both finished with a wicket, but it was the economy of these late spells that meant the innings finished on 154-7 off 35 overs, below par certainly but still a target that the Village would have to careful about making.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 36pt">Tea was served in the Green Room &ndash; sometimes referred to as the changing room &ndash; and so the Village prepared to face what was rumoured to be quite a handy Keevil attack. The openers were hostile and unpredictable, with some balls spitting off a length and others keeping low. A-Bomb fell for one after wearing a couple, eventually heaving at and nicking one well outside off stump which was initially called wide by the presiding Giles Tupper. The openers found it difficult to score runs &ndash; especially against the excellent Forsey, who bowled three consecutive maidens for his opening three overs.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 36pt">Plimmer joined Steve Harty at the crease with just ten on the board, but they proceeded to put 57 toogether, with some controlled cutting and driving from both being particular highlights. Steve eventually went for 37, including two sixes, as a ball from the useful change Hamblin seemed to cut back up the hill and feather the outside of the off pole.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 36pt">Bun Hampton joined Plimmer at the crease, and showed exactly what he was about by launching the slow bowler back over his head for a big six. But he never looked in control, and was gone shortly after, nicking a catch behind off a big attempted drive. He had aimed a few over the car park and failed to connect, much to the bowler&rsquo;s evident relief.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 36pt">Eklavya&rsquo;s typical approach to the crease &ndash; sartorially elegant, composed &ndash; was only partially in evidence today. His concentration appeared to be dented after he covered himself in the Keevil dust completing a quick single, and even more so as the running between the wickets &ndash; something Plimmer is always very keen to do &ndash; got ragged. Plimmer eventually went, top-scoring with 41, going after the same slow bowler as Bun.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 36pt">Morgans, confident after a nuggety knock the day before, strode to the crease and set about going after the useful if unconventional lefty, but misjudged the pace &ndash; it was slower than he expected &ndash; got underneath one and chipped a catch to gully. It was proving to be tricky for the Village with the score on 113-5. KP Bowman had a look in the eye of a man about to finish off a match, and set about doing so with some lovely cutting and biffing, he and Eklavya sharing what proved to be a crucial stand of 38. Ek contributed his fair share, with some wonderfully elegant strokeplay despite the situation.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 36pt">Both batsmen were calling for quick singles, and in the end a too-quick single was called. The captain was back in the pavilion, and all of a sudden it seemed that time as well as wickets were working against a Village victory. Mutterings were heard from the Village camp that the umpire was being unduly lenient with Keevil&rsquo;s young spinner, who at times struggled to control his line. The match may well have been over a long time before with strict wide-calling, but the game was still alive as Lucas came to the crease, who proved to be another victim of the combination of Eklavya&rsquo;s desire to get the match won and some sharp fielding from Keevil.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 36pt">Eklavya did in the end guide the Village home with only a few balls to spare, and although he may have felt that he was responsible for the run-outs, it was the right way to approach a tight chase with several wickets in hand. Pressure on the Keevil fielders probably accounted for an extra 10 runs in the Village total, which was the difference between a comfortable last over and a tough one.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 36pt">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-indent: 36pt">Man of the Match: Difficult to pinpoint as contributions came from across the team, with each Villager doing something. In the end, though, it has to come down to a batsman. Good though the bowling was, it was runs that were needed, and Dan Plimmer certainly provided those.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 36pt">Village Idiot: Apart from the misfiring communication leading to spilling a high catch, nothing stands out. Except perhaps that Page and Stevo set off to participate in a different game to make up the numbers, and ended up being two of about fifteen and as such surplus to requirements. &nbsp;</div>
