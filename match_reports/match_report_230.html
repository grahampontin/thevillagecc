<p>Chat: absent</p> </conditions><p>Summary: Exceptionally talented opening batter sends every Village bowler to all corners of the ground, finally perishes after recording first ever double ton against us. Village battle to try and reach mammoth total. Fail.</p>
<p>Detail: Having fought through the crowds of Henley boating enthusiasts and foreign language students, many Villagers arrived in Oxford early to witness the British and Irish <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/23210389">Lions put one over the Wallabies</a>. Buoyed by this and relishing the start of a rare heat wave in the ever delightful setting of St John's sports ground, many were hopeful for Stand In Captain Boa to record a maiden victory at the helm.</p>
<p>These hopes were shortlived. After approximately 2m 36s the Village were surprised to find the oppo had passed 50 for no loss. Another 9 seconds later and the total was up to 108 and bat #1 was being applauded for his century (you do the maths). Village bowlers came and went, and Haines played shot after shot. Each and every one was pure class. No hacks, hoiks or mows; just 4 after 6 after 4 after 6, all dispatched with ease. Village had a solitary chance to have Haines stumped when a leg side dross ball from Pitcher beat everything, but it was a tough chance for K-Bird behind the stumps and Haines was back in his ground promptly.</p>
<p>Having reached an unprecented 200 shortly after an early drinks break, Haines finally holed out to Boa on the mid-off boundary during a rare but tidy bowling spell from DI.</p>
<p>The rest of the Demijohns line-up chipped in with some handy cameos before being all out 7 balls short of their 40 overs on a surely insumountible 307.</p>
<p>Pick of the Village bowling was probably SB Tang, having returned to the side after a successful Twitter campaign launched by the Village and supported not at all by the Home Office*. Tang took 3 wickets with sometimes unplayable spin. DI deserved his 3 wickets, with Boa bagging 2 and White judiciously coming back on after the Haines carnage has subsided to pick up a scalp.</p>
<p>After the expected and always welcoming delightful tea, Village went out to bat now supported from the sidelines by Page who was perhaps slightly tired and emotional following speeches day. Ben put in a fine and measured knock to achieve 50 (probably) before missing a straight high one. Simon on loan from the Rain Men looked good for 11. Harty and Bird looked like they might be able to give us a fighting chance, then also a Harty-Morgans partnership offered a glimmer of hope, but when Harty was out for an excellent ton the Fat Lady came out and began chirping. DI had returned south early leaving VCC&nbsp;with only 9 bats, so the game was over when we were effectively all out 50 runs short.</p>
<p>Customary celebrations ensued. Don't ask this author what went on, as I was in bed by 9 with heatstroke.</p>
